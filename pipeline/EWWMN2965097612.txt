Today's episode is brought to you by the PICTEA AI Enhance International Equity ETF, ticker PQNT. You'll hear more about their using AI to enhance international equity returns later in the show. For now, let's get into it. Got a very special interview today. I am joined by Carson Block, founder of Muddy Waters Capital. Muddy Waters Capital is a leading activist short seller hedge fund, and they specialize in activist short selling. So selling short with the stocks alongside deep research. Carson, great to see you. Welcome. Yeah, thanks for having me back, Jack. There is fertile ground for short selling in 2021 and 2022. And when I look back at the excesses of that age, it was electric vehicles, you know, promising to be the next Tesla. It was green energy. When you look right now, whether it was the past year or the next year right now, what where are you seeing promising fishing? Not talking about names, but in terms of sectors, industries, themes, where where might the next frauds be, the fads, the overpromising, the next pockets of excessive speculation? What what is the fertile ground? The tech sector, obviously, and the industries within it. I mean, anything that can really start claiming to be AI or AI adjacent. And there are in many of those many of those industries, you're going to have the legitimate players. But because so much money is flowing there, you're you have a I'm sure a proliferation in many of these industries of pretenders. And so that's where you could look. But you have to wait till the time is right. And I'd say since second half of last year, been a very difficult time to try to short anything like that that has strong momentum. Who are the AI pretenders? Are these companies that are just promising a lot and their revenues are flat, not growing and they're losing money? Or are they growing a lot? You just think that they're attaching themselves to the theme and they're kind of, you know, trying to trying to play second fiddle? Well, the thing about AI, it's actually pretty broad in terms of where the money has flowed. So it's beyond just the companies that are directly in the AI model production space. And you've seen it spill over. Obviously, memory has ripped and those are real companies, although it's, it's interesting with the semis and with the semis, it's, that's actually generally not a great business model. It's so cyclical, it's so capex intensive. So to just see, you know, software do this and semis do that, you know, go up into the right is, is odd. But I don't know that there are pretender companies there. I would think at some point there should be mean reversion there because I just don't think that, you know, the fact that we have supply chain bottlenecks at this moment in time really makes these businesses that much more attractive from a long-term perspective. But you've had the spillover from AI, obviously power generation is been a big beneficiary. So there are these spaces that are AI adjacent. So the breadth of the flows of money here is it's, it's pretty wide. So within that, within those spaces, there are industries where, yeah, the companies that are more recently to the game are, you know, number of those are probably suspect and sure. And we're going to see IPOs I'm sure from, you know, the pretender. So, you know, usually the, the real leaders in a space, they'll go public and then, you know, the wannabes are going to go public behind them. And so those, those are in general, the ones that you should watch for now in terms of revenue. I mean, it depends exactly what we're talking about. And, you know, here, I also consider things like quantum computing to be adjacent. I mean, you've seen just some ridiculous price movements in, in those stocks as well. So, and they have, I mean, on revenue basis, you know, some of them have revenue, but it's just like ridiculous valuation. So, you know, those, those are, and there are arguments that, you know, substantially all of the quantum computing stocks that are public are pretenders or that quantum computing is just nowhere near being feasible. But, you know, I, I'd say that the problem isn't finding the short targets. The problem is going to be timing this, because again, with momentum so strong, and these are, these have all become momentum stocks. I mean, you get the timing wrong, you're just going to rip your, have your face ripped off. So yeah, I, I don't see that there's really, you know, much to do at this moment in time. I would much rather, if I were going to be playing this game, I would much rather go in and start shorting these things when they're clearly on the back end here. And they're, and they're sliding down. I mean, you know, these things have many billions of dollars of market cap in certain cases. You know, is it, is it like a bad idea to wait until that's halved? No, not necessarily. Not really, because there's still, you know, there's still probably massive overvaluation with these companies at that stage. So, you know, I, I think you're much better off waiting until you're convinced that, you know, there's just been this crushing of demand for speculative companies by likely an oversupply of these speculative companies. So that's how, that's how 2021 worked out, right? You had all of these SPACs and then de-SPAC transactions, you know, some reggae plus, you know, super dodgy IPOs, some conventional IPOs, and just the supply of speculative stocks overwhelmed the, the demand for it. So we'll get back to that point in time. And once we're there, then it makes sense. But until then, I think you'd be playing a very, very dangerous game to try to short some of these names. Even though you have an inkling that they might be extremely overhyped, not likely to generate profit anytime soon, even though you, you have a high conviction of those on the fundamentals, you, you're, you're waiting it out. Look, in the activist short world, there was a big report the last week of the week before on Carvana. I think they brought a lot of new news to the table. It's by Gotham City Research. And I don't know the name well, but it was initially a well-received report. I think it's rebounded, you know, largely or almost entirely from, from the report because momentum is so strong right now. The things we're looking at don't have, don't really have those, you know, aren't part of those baskets right now that have had really strong momentum. So, you know, I, you know, and I, I'd say that that's really from an activist short selling perspective. I think that's the way you have to play it for now. But you know, last year on the activist short side of the business, I mean, we didn't publish on any new names the second half of the year, because we just saw what was, you know, what was happening. And we published on two new names at the beginning of the year, or the first half FTIE and Applovin. But yeah, then those things just absolutely ripped the second half of the year. So it told us that it's just not the right time. How do you evaluate the thesis that you had when you published last year in the spring of 2025? How do you evaluate your thesis? And also, who are your potential counterparties? So it got added to the S&P 500 index. So there was a lot of buying institutional and I'm sure retail ahead of that, which created some momentum. Then you got the index fund buying once it was included. And yeah, I think there are institutions that play momentum. And look, to be clear, that's something that we're doing at Muddy Waters. You introduced us as an activist short selling firm. But while that is our core business, I mean, we've really diversified our business over the past several years. And so we have a quantitative momentum strategy where we go long 20 names in the S&P 500 index and we rebalance monthly. And last year on a gross basis, I think that was up about 70%, seven zero. I mean, it's just stupid. But it's fantastically easy money compared to the rest of what, or compared to activist short selling. So with Applovin, look, our focus there was on its purported ad tech AI where they were cheating. And there's no moat there because it's pretty crude how they're doing this. I mean, they're violating terms of service of the major platforms. And they're violating probably numerous state laws and maybe even federal law and also EU law. So if they're allowed to cheat, basically anybody can do this and erode their edge. But if Facebook, Google, et cetera are serious about enforcing their TOS, then it should become a problem. So we weren't attacking the core business, the gaming business. It was the blue sky story. And look, since we've published, There've been numerous other short reports written on it, some of the same angle, others different angles by various firms and I don't know, I guess maybe this is just me telling myself what I want to hear, but I think it's one of those things where 50 million Elvis fans can't be wrong. There's so many of us who find that this company is so messed up, eventually those chickens come home to roost, but in this super frothy market where everybody is anesthetized to risk, they're not coming home to roost just now. Carson, what causes cycles to reverse? What causes bubbles to pop? Generally these hype cycles will end when there are just too many speculative shitty companies that come to market. That's really my view of how the internet bubble ended in 2001. It wasn't Fed raising rates, it was you had so many IPOs of so many companies that effectively were trying to soak up money from the same theme, the same pool of money demand for high beta, fast growth, blue sky stories. That's what happened in 21 as well. While there is a lot of demand for speculative assets right now, eventually the supply will overreact and it will crush the demand. That's exactly when we'll be interested in publishing on names that had been in that space and had been run up on that huge hype cycle. Where do you think we are in that cycle now in terms of the demand for speculative assets, which is high, but also the supply of speculative assets? That supply exploded in late 2020 and early 2021. Jim Chanos has this stat about just the amount of millions of dollars that were being raised in SPAC capital and the amount that was needed to fund that. It was totally unsustainable. My read is that there haven't been a huge amount of IPOs or SPACs in last year. Do you think the flood is coming this year? I had expected more IPOs last year. I think that the Liberation Day tariff thing, I suspect that really disrupted the plans and created a lot of uncertainty. I don't know what the IPO calendar is looking like, so I'm speaking a bit out of school, but yes, I would expect 2026 to be a year in which a lot of companies come to market. It's in a different class than what we're talking about, but if you look at SpaceX combining with XAI and the idea that Elon wants to IPO the combined company before, I think in June or so, part of it driven by his concern that you're going to have OpenAI and some of the other large language model companies come to market with their own IPOs. I think that speaks to this dynamic that you will have a significant increase in supply. I don't think anybody's ever played the public company game better than Elon Musk has. If he's concerned about the potential oversupply of AI, et cetera, names relative to demand, I think that's telling. I would think that by the second half of this year, we're going to see a situation in which the demand is being overwhelmed by a supply of shitcos. And maybe the number of IPOs and public listings doesn't compare to 2021, but in terms of the amount of capital, because you only need one SpaceX or one OpenAI to go public to match all of the XL fleets of 2021. You think this ends because the supply of speculative assets exceeds the demand. I noticed you didn't say certain fundamental reasons, like the return on invested capital for these companies with the hyperscalers is not going to be sufficient to their cost of capital, which is an interesting academic theory, but can you talk about how sometimes theory isn't what happens? So as you were saying that, as you're talking about the return on invested capital, the phrase that went through my mind real quick was, who cares? At this point, I don't think fundamentals are relevant to what's going on. But the thing I'd say, I get asked all the time, okay, is this like the internet bubble? And you're looking at the hyperscalers and AI, and no, because for most of the hyperscalers, they have the cashflow to carry the debt that they're raising. These are tremendously cashflow generative businesses underlying them, whether it's Microsoft. Even Oracle, which has got somewhat of a higher leverage ratio, if they decided, hey, this money has all been wasted, and we're going to exit this, they could pay down that debt within a reasonable period of time. I'm not concerned about the credit worthiness of Oracle. CoreWeave is a different story, but the thing that's different here is that the hyperscalers, these are not, for the most part, startups. If an AI doesn't have that extremely cashflow generative business, but yeah, look at Google, look at Oracle, look at Microsoft, look at Facebook, Amazon, I mean, good God, making bad investments is not going to implode into building data center capacity to support build out of large language models or other AI models is not going to implode these companies. I mean, yes, the stock prices very well could take a hit. I'm not saying that they're correction proof, but this is not like the internet bubble where myass.com had no intrinsic value, went to a few billion dollars in market cap and then collapsed. That's not what's happening here. And even if these projects are a machine of cash incineration, they can recover like Meta did in 2022. Not an extinction level event by any means. No. CoreWeave, potentially different category. OpenAI, potentially different. But the other hyperscalers, no. I mean, they have real, they have enormous, hugely cash generative core businesses. So this is, so they are going to, they're going to be okay. Yes, it could take a hit to the equity prices or to the equity values at some stage, but not extinction level events. As soon as AI tools begin to wow the world, investors started asking, when will AI driven strategies become more common? The answer is that they're already here. Sophisticated quant hedge funds have been using machine learning strategies for many years, largely only for the benefit of institutional investors paying higher fees. Now with the barriers to usage coming down, AI machine learning approaches are being made available to you through products like the PICTAE AI Enhanced International Equity ETF, ticker PQNT. PQANT gives investors enhanced international returns in a low cost, tax efficient wrapper, using AI to take advantage of the types of hidden outperformance potential that human beings may not be able to detect or explain. And unlike many other active ETFs, PQANT isn't just taking factor risk, leaving you overexposed to specific sectors and betas or style exposures. Instead, PQANT helps neutralize factor exposure to minimize index tracking error. That means when it outperforms, it's coming from true idiosyncratic stock returns, not excessive risk or factor exposure. To learn more about how you can harness the power of AI in your portfolio, check out the link in the description to learn more.

Earlier, when I asked you about AI pretenders, you talked about, OK, the semiconductors, they can be quite cyclical, very capital intensive. But I think there's a, you know, you said something moderately positive about them. But you said that the players that are trying to latch on to the trade, maybe you mentioned power. Is sort of your questions about some of these companies, would they be would they be located in the data center but outside of the chip? It's funny because for the Robin Hood philanthropy last year, I participated, I'm participating again this year, but it goes from October to the end of April, beginning of October. So you pick one stock to be long, one stock to be short. And I picked Oklo as my long. I don't know the company well, but I have no basis to believe that in any realistic timeframe, it's small modular reactors are going to be a real business or that those designs are going to be a real business. And did very well for most of the contest. April, there was that that correction of the momentum names and then the contest ended. Then they started ripping again in May. So so Oklo is a great example, you know, like, well, data centers need power. Now, you know, anybody who claims to have a small modular reactor design, like even though, you know, that's many, many, many years off at best, in most of their cases. is like, it's never gonna happen. You know, those companies ripped and have real value. So that's an example of the spillover effects. But even though there were a lot of people who were skeptical of Oklo, yeah, it would have been a really bad idea to short it. And that's why I picked it as my long, you know, there was no real money underlying that bet. But you know, just in the cycle in which we're in right now, a hype-driven cycle, you know, speculative access. Right now, excess demand relative, you know, excess speculative demand relative to the supply of speculative assets. These things go up. So Oklo was your long, which performed well. What was your short? Griffles. So that was a Gotham City short that they'd already published. That did reasonably well for me as the short. But I mean, it's the long that's going to make you in that contest. So for a while, I was number two behind Bill Ackman. So I was ahead of, you know, like Stan Druckenmiller and Chase Coleman. I'm like, who are these guys? Monks. Nice. Last year, you shocked the investment world when you came out with a long idea. Is this the first time that you publicly did it? And what motivated you to make this call on Snowline Gold? As I said, we've diversified our business at Muddy Water. So I think it would help to explain what we're doing. So we're looking for, we're looking to plug people in to our firm. You could say it's kind of like a multi-strat model, but we're not doing this through one large fund. And we're not trying to get kind of middling returns for no vol. So we're bringing in people who are very talented, who have edge in areas where edge can persist. And so we've been in resources. We started collaborating with somebody back in 2017, who was at another fund. His name is Darren McLean. And when I say collaborating, he was the one who brought our, or caused us to pay attention to this one company called Asenco Gold that we ended up shorting very presciently, very successfully. Then he got us into GT Gold as a long, which was acquired by Newmont. So like, you know, I think five bagger for us relative to our first money. Then he got us into a company called Mayfair Gold, where we ended up running alongside activist campaign. And I'm on the board of Mayfair Gold presently. It just got a U.S. line as well. The ticker is mine, M-I-N-E. So all the little sidebar there, I guess that used to be the ticker of a really dodgy psilocybin blow up. So on the first day I was trading in the U.S., it looked like somebody came in and probably market maker, I guess, and shorted a bunch of mine stock, probably thinking was still the psilocybin company. But anyway, and then also we were long Filo Gold, which is a larger deposit, was acquired by the Lundin family. So Darren's very, very talented. And he left his former firm and came, technically he's a consultant to us. But so we launched a resource mining fund in 2024. And Darren is the chief research provider to us for that fund. So that fund, you know, is, I mean, done well. And anyway, one of its core holdings is Snowline Gold. So I spoke at the Irisone conference in London this past November, and I'd spoken there. I think that was my fourth year in a row speaking there. And I'd previously spoken there for a few years in a row before taking a little break. And I decided to pitch Snowline as a long. And it's one where there's a lot of asymmetry to it. Even if the price of the underlying declined significantly, we think Snowline gets taken out at 2x plus where it currently trades. And what is it that's so special about the deposit that Snowline has? So it's located in the Yukon in Canada. Now, Canada is a first world jurisdiction. There's a strong rule of law. And, you know, not in the immediate vicinity of the deposit, but not that far away. You have highways and infrastructure. Now, the knock on Snowline had been that, well, it's kind of remote and therefore it's too expensive to develop. But with Snowline, you've got a lot of near surface mineralization. It's going to be an open pit mine. They're going to be able to cash flow significantly at the beginning. So that really impacts positively the NPV. So we believe Snowline will support this becoming a mining district so that the investment that goes into Snowline or that it's economic to make this investment into Snowline to create the additional infrastructure needed and that it will then unlock a lot of the value in that district. Right now, it's the, we think, the most compelling, significant greenfield deposit that a major can make in the world. I mean, in gold. So we don't think it sits around that much longer, especially if, you know, with the price of gold, you know, anywhere close to where it is right now. Yeah. And all in sustaining costs of five hundred and sixty nine dollars an ounce for gold. That's a that is pretty cheap. And so the minerals that are going to be taken out in that initial phase, is that just gold or is there also like copper and silver and other other stuff? It's principally gold. It's not planning on producing until like twenty twenty nine or twenty thirty. So it does have a process. The thesis is not that they're going to produce so much gold quickly. It's that it's going to be acquired by a major. Right. And yeah, and majors have the capital. They have the patience to develop these. But, you know, the thing is, the majors, since the GFC, have spent very, very little on greenfield exploration. Substantially, all of their budgets have been brownfield. And the reason that difference, Carson. Yeah. So brownfield is a property that's already been mined. I mean, quite many cases, a major has already been mining it and they're exploring adjacent areas to see if they can, if there are other deposits there that are economic to exploit. So if there are, you know, because they already have infrastructure in place, the you know, the economics, the grade of the of the mineral, the rate of gold could be lower and it's still economic for them. So that's what brownfield exploration is. But generally speaking, you're not going to you're not going to have major additional discovery that moves the needle from brownfield. And the reason that the majors are stuck in that pattern is that coming out of the GFC, they had to repair their balance sheets. And so they had to cash flow. And that's when they slashed their exploration budgets. And then their shareholders got kind of addicted to the dividends and don't give them a lot of latitude to, you know, to explore greenfield projects. They have to acquire them because the thing is, I mean, these they're depleting their existing resources, right? Like there's no terminal value of of these resources. So as they deplete them, it becomes more and more urgent to acquire. And the other thing is, when you have a relatively small number of majors in a space, I mean, at some point they're going to have to look around and say, you know, we're going to look really bad or, you know, I as the CEO, I'm going to look really bad if I, you know, if I don't get out there and aggressively start to acquire because my competition is doing that. So we think it's just a matter of time before you really see that the transaction, velocity of transactions pick up and and we think Snowline gets acquired. You know, I mean, certainly by that stage. What are the green flags that you see in the Snowline as opposed to the red flags that you saw in the precious metal companies that you shorted? The idea that you have to commit fraud in the mining space is not entirely accurate because if you just change assumptions, right, based on your test drill and the intercepts, you just change the assumptions. Oh, in good faith, you can have a block model produced that shows, you know, a significant amount of mineralization at, you know, whatever grade you need to you need to show. And that's where Darren is really good at going into the block models, understanding the assumptions and picking them apart and saying, yeah, no, no, this this is this is not valid. Like this is not this is much less economic in the case with Snowline because there's so much mineralization so close to the surface. It's not a question of, you know, can you trust the block models? I mean, Darren's actually been to the property and he can see like literally see gold on the surface, you know, on, you know, of the land. So that's that's what makes Snowline so so unique is that it's that you have so much at or near surface mineralization. So from Darren. perspective, it's not, you know, we're not worried that the assumptions that have gone into the block model are aggressive. You know, again, the knock is the infrastructure. Now, there are other mining properties, you know, not for not for gold that are not far away. And, you know, in our view, again, is that the capex needed to develop these projects is more than justified by their economics. Is your minerals materials fund, is that long only or is it long short? It's long short. We run in that long. But but yeah, there are you know, there are some names where when we short something generally it's going to be it's going to be a producing miner. The idea of shorting a miner that's not in production can be very dangerous because, you know, they can continue to hype and, you know, and mislead for years. And once they're in production and we feel they're going to be unable to meet the expectations that they've set for the market or they've set for themselves in the market, that's what you would short. Can you just share your overall broad thesis of mining zoomed out? The reason that we were drawn to mining, we have had no view on the underlying metals, but there's tremendous edge available there. So number one in junior mining, you can get venture capital type returns, but you have much more data upon which to base your decisions than you do with venture. Now, the other thing is that there's been a significant under allocation of human capital, human and financial capital to mining since, you know, 2000 ish. Your smart university graduates, you know, gone into tech, gone into finance. They have not gone into mining and even on the capital allocation side. So the, you know, we've seen a lot of people in the space or, you know, I know Darren especially seen a lot of people in the space who they have good deposits, but they're just bad operators. They're not good business people. And you know, that when, when you, when the bar is low, basically in terms of the people against whom you're competing, this isn't to say that everybody in, you know, mining is not right. That's far from the truth. But when you consider, you know, how much talent, you know, you're, you're competing against if you're doing, if you're investing in software, there's so much more edge available in mining, especially junior mining. So that's been our macro thesis. It's really been about an under allocation of human capital and the complexity of going through the data. But again, the rewards for those who do do the work and know how to interpret the data. How do you differentiate sort of the precious metals beta versus the alpha in stock selection on the long and the short side? So I imagine that, you know, almost every precious metals fund has had a positive performance, you know, S&P beating performance and, you know, that's that gold and silver going up so much has helped them immensely. How do you think about the value add throughout a different cycle? Are you trying to outperform the most when the metal goes up or are you trying to outperform the most when the metal goes down? So we don't think about it that way. We're very long term focused here. So our fund has a three year hard lock. So we're basically telling investors, look, it's going to be volatile. It's going to we're going to make highly a lot of the positions will be highly concentrated. You could see because we own, I think, 16 percent of Mayfair gold and we own it across a few funds. But that's obviously a highly concentrated position for us in the resource fund. So, you know, we're I mean, when we when we go along, I mean, we're generally especially for something concentrated and we're generally looking at something that, you know, we believe can be a multi bagger and, you know, that's even using conservative assumptions on metal price. And we're not you know, we don't we don't do only gold and silver. You know, also, you know, we've done we've done this amount of copper. I mean, GT gold, despite the name, was really a copper producer or copper miner wasn't producing. It's not a short term project for us. Now, you know, we ran last year on a Delta adjusted basis, not say Delta adjusted because we did a decent amount of hedging using derivatives. But we ran only, I'd say, 50, 60 net long on average throughout the year. And, you know, I mean, we're you know, the I mean, like I think legally I can discuss the returns, but I don't want to be too specific because I don't want to like having to do it every month. I mean, on a net basis, we returned to investors like a little over 100 percent last year. Again, on a Delta adjusted basis, running, you know, 50, 60 net long throughout the year. You know, beta certainly helped, but there was there was alpha two there. What's most interesting to you and to Darren right now? We have been spending most of our time recently in the gold space. But I think that's just you know, that's because you've had such a large move in the metal. So things that were, you know, that were not economic before are economic and you're seeing more financing, seeing just more activity among, you know, issuers in the space. So there's there's more to look at there. But look, if you if you think long term, you know, that we're going to increase the electrification of our economy or, you know, the many, you know, the developed economies are going to do that. Obviously, that's going to require a lot of copper and a lot of other base metals to be pulled from the ground. So, you know, we're, you know, you know, we're agnostic in that regard. You mentioned when I asked you about red flags, you talked about how people could just change assumptions ever so slightly. And that leads to financial implications that could look very good on an investor presentation. When it comes to other forms of red flags about communicating with investors and presentations, you're a tried and true veteran of seeing this in the non mining space. What are some of those things? I mean, one thing that comes to mind for me, it kind of drives me crazy. And maybe I'm wrong about this, but it's just a commodity intensive, it's not commodity businesses that require tons of investment like oil and gas or mining that quote free cash flow multiples when investment is extremely important to the business. So it's completely misleading. I don't know, maybe you disagree with me on that. But what else is something that if you see it, it's just kind of like an aha moment, like, hmm, this is likely not going to be something that I want to participate on the long side. In the same way, you know, if in 2021, you saw an investor deck of a SPAC company and within the first four slides, it had the word TAM, total addressable market, you knew that it was not going to be, you know, it was a prime target on the short side. The thing that we see is that there are these junior miners out there that are pushing these these timelines to get approval and get into production that we just think are way too aggressive. Like, it's like, yeah, okay. Even if even if we say that, okay, your resource is everything that you know, you say it is more or less, which there is a lot of exaggeration, not fraud, but just a lot of bad assumptions that lead to exaggerations. But even if you put that to the side, there are companies out there that are making these, you know, making these pronouncements, these predictions about how quickly they can get into production where, you know, we're like, no way, like, that's just no, no, you're years off the mark based on where you are. So that's something that is jumping out to us early on now. There's nothing for us to do with that, because again, I go back to how we generally as a rule are not going to short a non-producing miner. And you know, we're not going to go along that. So that's that goes in the pile of nothing to do, unfortunately. When you look at geopolitics, what are the thoughts you're having? What is the work you're doing in Southeast Asia? Well, I guess taking a step back. So yes, we're in Cold War 2.0. We've been in that for a while. You've got China on one end or China, Russia on one end, although Russia is from an economic perspective, obviously much less important than China than the U.S. on the other end. And the countries that I think are best positioned from a geopolitical standpoint are the ones that are generally have been non-aligned and are in the middle and can play the U.S. and China off one another. So that's been like Vietnam. And also India is is a similar country. So I mean, and we're also talking about countries that have their own, you know, have something more than just, you know, we're not leaning too much one way or another, that they're you know, that their economic value add in their economies. So those are two countries that we're excited about from a from a long term perspective. I haven't seen a ton of short reports from you about China. Do you think that they have improved in terms of their reporting quality, or is there some other reason that you have not shorted that many Chinese companies? I mean, I think in 2021 or 2022, you shorted a Chinese real estate company. But yeah, what you know, where's are there is there luck in for it? Luck in coffee, Sinophores. Are there still those lurking in China? Look, you have to also differentiate between a Luckin and a Sinophores, right? Like Luckin had a real business. Strangely enough, like it's, you know, I think it's, you know, I think it's actually if it hasn't already relisted on a U.S. exchange, it's about to. But Sinophores didn't have a real business. How many major market cap companies from China are there trading in the U.S. or Hong Kong that don't have real businesses? I don't know. I mean, it's, you know, they generally the businesses have been real ish, from what I can tell. Now, are the financials honest? No. I mean, I've I've said for years that I think you should assume that some portion of China based companies, public China based companies, financials are fraudulent. And if you want to be kind about it, it's hey, they're competing for capital against guys who are cheating. So, you know, you know, cheat or die, basically cheat or don't get the capital. That is Chinese listed companies, would you say, have fraudulent parts of their financials? I'm going to exclude mainland China listed companies because the you know, there's there's an asymmetry of, you know, ripping off foreign investors, I mean, especially, you know, American investors, where you never get in trouble in China for doing that. Like literally, you do not. There has only been one person who was ever materially punished for listing a company in the U.S. that was based in China that was a total fraud. That guy's name was Dixon Lee, and he did prison time in the U.S. because he's Taiwanese. So the Chinese dudes, they rode off into the sunset and, you know, laughing, I'm sure. So China is not ever going to cooperate. So, you know, the heads, I win, tails, I don't lose dynamic. I mean, it's just, you know, as Charlie Munger used to say, show me the incentive, I'll show you the outcome. Like, what do you think the outcome of that's going to be if you don't, if you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by attempting to defraud American investors? Now, Hong Kong, it's a little different. You know, Hong Kong, in theory, you know, now that it's I mean, it's part of China and it's become more mainland defied by, you know, significant factors since 2019. In theory, defrauding investors through the Hong Kong exchange could lead to significant adverse consequences in mainland China. But I just feel like the Hong Kong market is such a cesspit with so many frauds and scams. I mean, it's funny, like every now and then, if you look, you know, at Hong Kong and pay some attention, you'll see some stock go up, you know, really short order go up like five, 10 times, you know, get that market cap north of a billion where the, you know, stupid foreign index funds have to come in and buy because it's been added to the index. And then it just, you know, one day, like the chairman will stop manipulating the stock and it gets halted down like 87% within minutes, right? Like you just find these stocks that fall out of the sky all the time in Hong Kong. This is not a real market with, you know, I mean, with, you know, by the standards of like Western markets. So, you know, so, yeah, I think that Hong Kong, even though in theory, it's not as asymmetrical from a risk reward perspective for fraud, you know, for fraudsters and scammers, there's just so much safety in numbers there that, you know, a lot of guys get away with it and almost everything you should assume, you know, has got at least a little bit of a problem there. And then, of course, you've had here in the US, like the Chinese micro cap scams, the pump and dumps here, which I don't know, man. I mean, if you're falling for that today, like, I don't know, don't tell me that you got fooled, right? Like, you knew it was a pump and dump. You just hope that you were early enough that, you know, you wouldn't be left holding the bag. You know, it's kind of, yeah, it's like, I can't, you know, should they be allowed to do that in America? Of course not. You know, are our exchanges such whores, you know, to allow it? Yes, of course they are. What else is new? They are complete whores. And so are all the lawyers that facilitate it and the PR firms that facilitate it. Like, it is what it is. So, yeah, if you want to play that game as an investor, you know, caveat emptor, there's a very good chance that, you know, your like WhatsApp group or whatever it is that they're using to pump it is, is not like the inside circle of the pumpers. And, you know, you're eventually going to be left holding the bag. So, you know, I think it was, it was a Trump who said, no crying in the casino. You know, that's, that's the game you play, you know, be prepared. So you have three sort of tiers. You actually think that the fraud is the least in the A shares listed in mainland China. And then in the middle is kind of that the Hong Kong shares and the worst, the most fraudulent, most junkier, actually the American listed Chinese companies. So I've not taken a comprehensive look at A share listings, but my, my assumptions have long been like, number one, a lot of these businesses are fairly basic industrial manufacturing businesses. So, you know, you're not reinventing the wheel. The other also, when you look at, you know, in the U S especially in the China fraud caps, 1.0, a lot of the businesses that were total frauds were basic manufacturing businesses like paper company. However, what allowed those to flourish as frauds were the language barriers, the cultural barriers, the lack of understanding of the Chinese legal system and accounting system and, you know, and, and how to get information on those companies, you know, such as through government agencies in China. All right. Well in China, those, those information, those understandings or misunderstandings don't exist. Right. So, and also look, I think the time change, the time zone difference also, you know, is somewhat helpful for those, those fraud caps. So in mainland China, a lot of the businesses are much more basic, harder to, you know, totally lie about number one, number two, much more easily diligence and better understood by the investors there. Number three, you know, if the wrong people lose money there, the consequences are quite severe. So you have real punishment there. So, you know, is it that there's no fraud in the mainland markets? No, I'm sure that that would, is not an accurate statement, but I've always assumed that the mainland market would be the cleanest place to buy, you know, to invest in a Chinese company. And the reason for you not playing on the short side in, in Chinese American listed ADRs is just, you're not, you're not seeing opportunity there. The issue isn't, you know, oh, we can't find anything that's, you know, like totally misrepresented and, you know, and therefore misunderstood. But China, it's, there's so much more macro that is behind those names. You know, the Chinese TMT names are in favor. Nobody cares that it's a fraud. They're out of favor. You know, maybe, you know, maybe you caught it right before they fell out of favor and you look like a genius, but you have just a lot of macro, you know, flows that really determine what's going to happen there. Number one, number two, the SEC cannot investigate those companies generally, cannot erase those companies because the Chinese side does not cooperate. So you really have to like luck and coffee rely on the auditor doing a, you know, doing somewhat of a thorough job. And that's usually not in the auditor's interest to do that, especially in China, where, you know, if the auditor doesn't like turn up the fraud or, you know, turn up evidence of the fraud, you know, probably nothing happens to anybody ever. And yeah, then the, you know, then the final thing is it's, it's a lot harder to do that work in China now. You know, the government is generally not permissive of that. And, you know, they'll, they've, they've taken extreme measures, including putting people in prison who've done just low level investigative work, you know, taking videos and photos, you know, not having any share of the economics in the short, just, you know, being paid by their investigation firm employer or, you know, a contractor to go out, you know, here a few hundred dollars, go snap some photos. And, you know, I know one case where the dude went to prison for, I think, a couple of years. And so you have a Southeast Asian fund now, is it only invested in Vietnam or it's Vietnam and India? The fund has been Vietnam only. And, you know, we are going to be launching an India product. I mean, India is a much larger market. There are a lot more names there. It's a lot more dynamic and benefits from some of the same trends, macro trends that Vietnam benefits from. It has some of its, you know, but it also has its own different story as well. Very strong consumer growth story. So but, you know, similar, similar point there that there's edge in doing deep research there because not a lot of people are doing that there. So we are, we will go places or add strategy. strategies where there's edge. I mean, if somebody came to me and said, hey, I do XYZ and I do well in it and here's why it's niche and here's why there's edge, we're very interested in having conversation with that person about plugging him or her into our platform. So India, we think you can have edge there just like we do with Vietnam. And I believe it states that India has a ton of companies, maybe even more listed companies than in America, whereas I've heard that Vietnam does not have that many listings. Vietnam, you know, its economy is much smaller than that of India. The public market is that is much smaller than that of India. So, yes, we're able to take advantage of the infrastructure we have in Vietnam to do the India expansion, because, you know, at this point, I mean, we know pretty much all the companies that are in the universe that we would consider investable in Vietnam, whereas, you know, in India, I mean, it would take a whole lifetime to get to that stage, I think. You mentioned a broad macro thesis of with the U.S. and China having a little bit of a Cold War, companies that are in the middle like Vietnam and India are going to benefit. So I imagine that is a thesis that could be a tide that could lift many boats. But what was it specifically about Vietnam that was it? Was it the opportunity? Were you so bullish on Vietnam beta or were you bullish on Vietnam alpha of like, OK, let's be honest, there are a lot of funds that, you know, invest in Japanese equities. And some of those funds are actually very smart people. And so we want to compete in a world where we, you know, we can really differentiate ourselves. I'd say the principal thesis was Vietnam beta. I mean, the way that I saw it six years ago was that coming out of COVID, there would be in the Vietnam would be the single largest beneficiary of FDI flows being redirected from China to Vietnam or to and to other countries. I think that has played out and will continue to play out. Liberation Day was a massive volatility event when it came to that. I think initially the tariff that was announced on imports from Vietnam was like 90 percent ish, which was insane. But, you know, not withstanding that, Vietnam is a premier destination for export oriented manufacturers and it is also working its way up the value chain. Now, it's never going to be China. It just doesn't have cannot have that scale. But it also has very favorable demographics. India is somewhat of a different story. And look, one thing that we are having to watch closely, of course, is what impact. I don't call this AI because, you know, I I'm like these are large language models, but one impact large language models will have on the tech sector in India and specifically software outsource, software development and business process outsourcing and what that will do to consumer demand in India. So that's something that we're watching. But, you know, for the moment, we're very positive on India, although the valuations in India are pretty crazy. But, you know, I've I've come to kind of feel like, you know, in today's world, there's so much liquidity that, you know, you know, valuation doesn't really determine whether something goes, you know, up or down in the near term. It's you know, there are other factors, there are flows that drive these that drive these things that are can be completely divorced from fundamentals and valuation. And what is your process specifically for the ongoing Vietnam fund? It's great to trawl this to trawl the ocean for the undiscovered gems. But the problem is, if you're really the only one doing that, you know, who's your marginal buyer? Who's going to buy after you buy? So it's kind of a depressing state of affairs when I think about how I view investing on the long side now, because, look, I want to I want to live in a world where where valuations and where price where prices match actual economic values and where it is, you know, where you can go and find those undiscovered gems. And, you know, and the price eventually catches up with the value, you know, with the value of the business. But that's not the world that we live in. And so there's you know, so there's been an adjustment basically say, look, you know, what are investors excited about? You know, what might they be excited about next? Let's look at the companies in that space. You know, let's look at who we like the best and, you know, do some real deep research on it. You know, maybe it's one that's not, you know, that's not at the top of the list in terms of what investors are paying attention to, but what we think can move up that list. You know, maybe it is at the top of the list and we'll look at it and say, but it's so richly valued right now. We just, you know, we, we can't like, you know, we can't buy it right now, but we'll be patient and wait for something to happen and then buy it. But that's, that's the adjustment that, you know, that I've made. I mean, so when we started this journey and, you know, focusing on Vietnam and, you know, also had in mind the India theme six years ago the idea was to be, was to be bottom up. But, you know, what we've seen as short sellers here, what we have seen in Vietnam, what we observe of India, and also just, you know, I've done personally very well in our momentum strategy here for S&P 500 names. All of this has just convinced me that think about themes. It's not reinventing the wheel. Just, you know, like top down and, and stop trying to go where nobody has been yet because they're probably not going to show up anytime soon either. I'm just looking at the MSCI Vietnam index. So yeah, last year it had incredible performance 2025, but it has definitely been a laggard over the past many years. To what do you attribute that? And do you think that your thesis of Vietnam is going to be a recipient of foreign direct investment flows that otherwise would have gone into China? That thesis was correct, but is it propelling investment performance and capital returns? Yeah, we think it's been a laggard because under the, under the prior government, there was a lot of, there were a lot of decisions that were just, there was total decision paralysis, you know, from the municipal provincial levels on up to the central level. And so I'd say that the wounds were somewhat self-inflicted. And by having that decision paralysis, I mean, it's not just about state-owned enterprises. There's this entire, you know, it's about private companies getting approval to expand. And, you know, and then look, they, they came out of COVID as well. So they had to like many economies, they had to start from, you know, standing start, basically. We did see an acceleration in what we're interested in, in terms of the decision-making process, projects being unlocked that, you know, we think will unlock value and, you know, increase demand within, within Vietnam. So I think on the macro level, you know, we've in, just in terms of the FDI flows, we've been correct. I mean, 90% tariff would have, you know, would have really put that thesis at risk, but of course that was pretty quickly dialed back. But so we've, the macro thesis has been correct. I think it'll continue to be correct. The, the political environment needed to change. I think we underappreciated that at the beginning. We think the political environment is where it really needs to be for the private sector. I think we underappreciated the thematic nature here in that we've been going after too many of those, you know, looking, looking for the undiscovered gems, which just not really the right way to play it. And those undiscovered gems, a lot of them, as you say, stay undiscovered. Tell us about the momentum strategy in the U.S. for the S&P 500. And what does it say about the investment landscape right now, that that is kind of the hottest strategy you have right now is just kind of no fundamental analysis chasing the hottest stocks? It's not the hottest. Resources did outperform it last year. Okay. Thank you for correcting. I think momentum was up gross 70-ish percent. I'm soft on that number because it, you know, it I'd have to go back and look exactly, but we yeah, but basically, I mean, what we're doing every month, so we have the way that we measure momentum. It's only on within S&P 500 constituents. And we're rebalancing monthly, highly concentrated in the names that score the highest. So there, you know, there can be a lot of volatility on the downside. Now, I mean, we've well, and the upside, but we also have a version of this we could run that would have roughly a hundred names and less concentration. But but in any event, that's how we, that's how we have approached this. We started running it in October of 24 in real life in very small size in one of our vehicles. Before October of 24, we had backtests. So what we've observed and also seen in backtests is that, you know, it was interesting, like the number one name in left curve from October. of 24 until September of 25 was Palantir. And then in starting in September of 25, it became Western Digital. And after it became Western Digital and, you know, in both Micron and Seagate at different times made it into the list as well. After that is when, maybe two months after that's when got that headline about the memory shortage and the squeeze. And so looking at that, you know, looking at the back test, what you can see at times from this, you know, from the strategy is that it's showing the rotations that like it's a leading indicator of some of the rotations that are underway, you know, to energy, away from energy, you know, in the back tests. So to AI and then AI gets, you know, then it goes from like the AI software to the hardware. We started to see some resources creep in, but, you know, the last trading day of last month, you know, zeroed out this one resource name that had been really strong. So yeah, so it's a very interesting strategy like that. And it's definitely the vast majority of the time, it has not been, it has not had a major concentration in mag seven names. So it's not a mag seven name. And that's, I mean, at times like UAL has been in there and what have you. So, so yeah, it's, you know, look, it's much easier way to make money, I'd say than activist short selling. So that's what I like about it. You've done it during a quite a big, strong bull market. What do you think this is going to do during a bear market? Obviously not, you know, not asking for projections, but just in terms of a back test and your, you know, your personal opinion. So these are all S&P 500 constituents. So really none of these should ever be totally fake companies. I mean, they're real businesses. Back test in 2022 on a gross basis. So the S&P 500 closed down 18% for the year and on a gross basis on a back test, you know, at least back test of a version, you know, it was maybe a couple of versions ago. This finished up for the year, I think maybe 10 to 12%. In 2022. Yeah, in 22. So again, that's hypothetical, that's back test. And we've tweaked the model some since then. You know, obviously I think for the better, but yeah, it's not to say that this can't lose money. I mean, of course it can lose money, but you know, what I also think is interesting is because, you know, we're, you know, our core business has been activist short selling, you know, I think it could be really interesting to pair long side exposure, you know, to something, you know, momentum, you know, like Left Curve with, you know, some version of our short book. So, you know, that's a strategy that we're testing out as well right now. I mean, such a accomplished fundamental research and investing shop on the short side as yourself and Muddy Waters, that you are, you know, so interested in quantitative momentum investing. I just think that speaks to the time that we're in right now. It does definitely speak to the time that we're in. Yeah, and look, I mean, I think it also, you know, it also speaks to our pragmatism as a firm, right? Like, I mean, the, you know, on the short side, I think the one of the problems is that so often, and I've been guilty of this many times over the years, I think less so now, but, you know, we view the world the way we want it to be, not the way that it actually is. And so we made a decision several years ago, we're business, right? Like we're an asset manager and we want, and we want to broaden out what we do. Core business is activist short selling, but yeah, if something is a niche that looks like it can make real money, you know, and I'm not interested in, you know, oh, we can produce nine to 10% with no vol, you know, with very little vol, like that's uninteresting. But if we have stuff that can, you know, can really generate significant returns, we're excited about possibly adding those strategies and people who can manage them. Carson, your last report from Muddy Waters Research was in May of 2025, so many, many months ago. Can you give our listeners reassurance that your days of activist short selling are not over and that you will be back? It's early February right now. I mean, I think by the end of February, we're out on something. Certainly by the end of March, we're probably out on a few things. So yeah. You got a few things cooking. Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, I'm actually, I've like started, you know, almost nervously tapping my foot here because I know I've got to get back and write something, write, you know, work on my writing on something right now that's an activist short, you know, piece. So, so yeah. Not to mean that it comes out this month, but there's something that is time sensitive here with it. So, so yeah, we're, you know, we're fully engaged, but, you know, just the idea of shorting something that has really strong momentum right now, bad idea. That is a good conclusion to draw from this conversation, Carson. Thanks so much for joining. People can find Muddy Waters Research on X at MuddyWatersRe, the website MuddyWatersResearch.com.
