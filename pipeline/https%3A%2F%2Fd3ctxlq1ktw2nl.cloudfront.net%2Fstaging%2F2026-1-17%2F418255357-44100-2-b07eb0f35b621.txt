Welcome back to another episode of the Jack Malers Show, I am your host, Jack.
You're listening to yet another edition of mail, bag, Monday, 6 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m.
Central, 3 p.m. Pacific time, all signal, no noise and no ads.
Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, let's get this show on the road.
I'm talking to you all at a Bitcoin price, I'm talking to you at a Bitcoin price of $68,530
US dollars.
That puts Bitcoin's market cap at a $1.37 trillion in size.
We are still hanging down towards the recent lows.
Once all-time high price remains at $126,160, we are over 45% off that all-time
high that was made on October 6, 2025.
It has now been 133 days since we made it all-time high for those keeping score at home.
What about the Bitcoin block height?
What was the last Bitcoin block mine since I hit stream?
It was Bitcoin block 936,984.
That is how we timestamp these shows here on the Jackmallers show.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, here's the deal.
It's a holiday in the United States, so I got no Dylan.
So I don't know how I'm going to do Q&A.
You guys are probably asking questions in the chat, but I got to do the show.
I can't really see the chat, so I'm going to try and do my best.
I'm also a little bit under the weather, nothing major though.
I know I'm a champion, you know I'm a man of the people.
Nothing's going to stop me from fighting for the man, for the common man, excuse me, slip
typo there, little mouse slip, fighting for the common man, but a little bit of a cold
nonetheless.
So my plan going into it was to keep the episode a little short, not a bad way, but some
of the feedback you guys give me is the show is super repetitive.
I don't know what to do about that, I mean, the same story lines are dominating our everyday
lives here, so I've tightened it up a little bit.
I have a new section of the show that I think is hilarious, ultimately you guys will be
the judge of that, and then we'll do Q&A a little bit live, okay, so I'll just open up
the chat.
You guys will ask me what you want, that'll be interesting, we'll see how well I interact
with the chat, sometimes the chat throws punches at me and I throw punches back, so
that'll be fun.
And then we'll call it a day, fair game, little special edition holiday edition of Jack
Malachio.
So without further ado, let's go.
Today's episode is titled Japan AI in the next liquidity shock in why Bitcoin's weakness
is in early warning.
And so I want to pull it up the chat and I just played my own voice, that's always tough,
and it's always a tough scene hearing your own voice.
Anyway, all right, here we go.
Japan AI in the next liquidity shock, why Bitcoin's weakness is in early warning, and
the reason that this is a little bit repetitive is because I'm going to be talking about
a very similar message to what I've been saying over the last six months, maybe it depends
on when you start counting.
But guys, I mean, the story is the story.
Above all else, above entertainment value, above having fun, I do this to spit facts, tell
truth, try and be part of the public conversation in a really unique way.
No political bias, no corporate bias, no ads, just truth.
And the story remains the same.
Bitcoin's weakness is telling us something.
It's telling us when liquidity is weak, when liquidity is abundant, when liquidity is abundant,
Bitcoin is shrieking high and price discovery and making new highs.
And when liquidity is weak, Bitcoin's the first to move.
We've talked off on on the show because of truth machine.
It's the only truly free market we have left.
It's like a liquidity smoke alarm, okay.
And in my opinion, liquidity is starting to get really scarce for two main reasons, and we
talk about it frequently on the show.
One is Japan, and what's happening in Japan.
We've talked about that.
That's the biggest macro story in the world right now and increasingly so.
And the other is AI.
The rate at which AI, so as you guys know, if you look closely, if you're watching
the visuals here, if you look closely, I'm running this slide show on local host 8,000.
I use AI to make the show.
AI has improved my life so much and it is true.
It's been in the last three to six months in particular, changed how we do everything
at strike.
It's really picking up and there are pros to that.
It's enhanced my productivity in my life tremendously.
There are cons.
And we've talked about how it really disintermediates the white collar worker.
And the United States is full of white collar workers.
We talk about how the blue collar jobs are in China.
And so the rise of AI is the death of jobs in America.
And the combination of those two seemingly are causing really serious issues.
And those issues are starting to take hold and bitcoins giving us a clue as to what's
to come.
So the thesis of the episode is really this venn diagram chart that I made here.
So for those listening, I've got one circle which is sovereign debt, which is just government
being so indebted.
You know, you got debt to GDP of the United States at around 130% you've got debt to
GDP in Japan at over 200% then you've got this other circle of AI deflation, okay?
And that is the better AI gets at making us more efficient.
The more jobs we're going to lose, the more jobs we're going to lose, the less taxes
the United States collects, the less taxes the United States collects, the higher treasure
yields go, the higher it starts to death spiral.
And so AI deflation, we know well and good that in inflationary monetary regime does not
like a deflationary technology.
And then the third circle I have is just tightness of liquidity.
We know the Jerome Powell has not cut rates like Trump wants to run it hot, Trump wants
growth 20% plus growth and liquidity has remained tight.
Now the Fed is back raising their balance sheet, quantitative tightening is over, but
it's not monetary policy, it is not as easy as the administration has wanted.
So you've got this combination of these three circles, sovereign debt, AI deflation and
tight liquidity, which to me is starting to result in a liquidity shock, I think we're
going to get some form of a crisis soon and Bitcoin is really telling us that.
So the first chapter is Hello Darkness, my old friend, under the surface things are
looking bleak.
So a few things like really caught my eye over the last week, it started to look really,
bad out there.
For starters, the world uncertainty index has never been higher and like way higher.
It is almost double what the world uncertainty index was in COVID.
And mind you, it's titled here.
So for those listening on the far left, you've got 9-11, slightly above 9-11 was the
Iraq War, slightly above the Iraq War was COVID and now you have what's happening in 2025.
The visual has it titled as the trade war, but I disagree with that.
Yes, we're in a trade war with China, but I would say sovereign debt crisis slash AI is
probably more accurately.
What is driving this level of certainty slash new world order?
Like slash we took over Venezuela slash we want Greenland slash at the World Economic
Forum, everyone mutually agreed that the post-1945 post World War II economic order is
dead slash globalism is ending.
So it's definitely not just the trade war, but I think everyone would agree that the
level of uncertainty is at an all time high and it's interesting and I'll get into this
later, but there's an AI CEO that wrote a very long letter about how this to him feels
like the few months prior to COVID really becoming a mainstream crisis.
I remember those days vividly where I was on Twitter and people that I really respect
and I think are brilliant were like there is a crisis around the corner.
Something bad is about to happen and at the time if you were like stacking toilet paper
in February of 2020, you were a nutcase, you're like what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
I could go outside, I could go to the grocery store, I'm going to my job.
Why are you stockpiling toilet paper?
But then come March in April 2020, you were genius.
And so it's interesting, okay.
Let's move on.
Downwards revision incoming.
So Anna Wong, lead economist at Bloomberg.
She tweeted this last week, which came out of nowhere at this point I have to start expecting
it.
On jobs, we are expecting about 666,000 downward revisions to March 2025 payrolls.
And then she says after including birth and death model updates, the total downward
revision should be a million, like what, first of all, what's the point of using this data?
If all we do is later revise it down a million, like what's the point of publishing the
data in the first place?
So anyways, as of yesterday, she was right, breaking US job numbers were revised down
one million 29,000 jobs.
The largest annual revision in the last 20 years.
This follows downward revisions of 818,000 in 2024, 306,000 in 2023.
So in total, over 2.1 million jobs have been revised out of the initially reported data
over the last 3 years.
Our rate cuts back on, now that we know that all the job data that said the economy was
doing fine and everyone was employed isn't true.
And here's the other thing, if things were bad, let's say liquidity is getting tight.
Let's say sovereign debt is really reaching crisis levels as we're seeing in Japan.
And let's say AI is really starting to take everyone's jobs and we're reaching that level
of an inflection point.
But one of the things that we would see are delinquencies, delinquencies would start to
trend up.
And oh boy, are they trending up?
That's kind of why, listen, I don't want to repeat topics too much.
I want the show to be interesting.
I know I ate get repetitive, but guys, I can't help it.
I mean, this from Bloomberg, US consumer delinquencies jumped to highest in almost a decade.
If these aren't warning signs, then I don't know what is.
You pair this with the recent Bitcoin price action, with the revision of jobs, with what's
happening in Japan, it's starting to look really dicey.
So deflationary force meets a debt system, deflation doesn't like inflation.
So this is an image from that Bloomberg article,
debt and default, the share of US loans and delinquency is at its highest since 2017.
It's June 26, so that's almost a decade.
And you can see that delinquencies are rising.
And then in the article, you guys should read it.
It talks about how housing is the main driver.
And housing's really the main driver in all consumer affordability crisis issues.
It's the thing that's people need the most, which is a roof over their head.
It drives the affordability crisis the most.
And they claim that mortgages and defaulting on your mortgage,
is the driver to delinquencies.
However, if you pull on the thread a little bit, you're like, well, hold on a second.
If we fix the mortgage crisis, which by the way, there's no fixing that.
It's just printing money.
But allow me to talk like a Keynesian for a second.
If we fix the mortgage crisis, well, would delinquencies resolve of themselves.
And the answer is absolutely not.
There's, I mean, I could have made this a million slides long.
Their delinquency crisis in student debt, this tweet here, share of credit card loans and
serious delinquency rose to 12.7% in the fourth quarter of 2025.
The only other times the share has been higher is 2010 in the beginning of 2011,
which obviously, my view was right after the global financial crisis.
And so, there are delinquencies in consumer credit across the board.
Across the board, it is not good.
And these are the type of signals that you'd see.
If the Bitcoin price is dislocated, but it's because Binance blew up when one was
insolvent, or for some obvious reason, then you buy the dip.
And we've all seen a Bitcoin chart like that.
V-shaped recovery.
If Bitcoin looks weak, again, guys, never fade the truth.
Never fade open source software.
Never faded, truly distributed network.
Bitcoin is honest.
Don't fight it, just listen to it.
That's part of the, you know, kill your ego, stay humble, aspect of Bitcoin.
It's trying to tell you something.
When I look at delinquencies on the rise, and I look at a dislocated Bitcoin price,
and I look at the Japanese markets, I think a crisis is brewing.
Which, again, policymakers will never print the money without a crisis.
It is politically not okay to ignite inflation, wartime spending, without an excuse.
But I don't know, I mean, like to me, it's time to turn on your DCA's and start to
average into this dip, because Bitcoin, to me, looks like it's telling us that there's bad news
around the corner.
So now that we know delinquencies are on the rise, every single index you can care about,
consumer, confidence, index, everything, bad, really bad.
Let's take a look at Japan.
So the title of this chapter, Japan is flashing red.
The largest story in macro economics.
Okay, this chart, shoot.
Let me see if I can blow it up a little bit.
Here we go.
So this is from the financial times.
The title of this visual is, if forward markets are a guide to the future,
debt service is set to explode.
Now, by looking at the metrics of the show, a very healthy chunky you guys listen to this as a podcast.
So I'm going to do my best.
This is easily the most important graphic of the whole presentation, by far.
So here's what this thing is attempting to show.
So in the subtitle, it says light bubbles show a 2036 projection.
So 2036, the year is 2026 right now.
So that's 10 years forward.
And what it's using is it's using bond markets to forward project expected rates.
And so what it has is on the x-axis.
Let me scroll down a little bit.
It has debt to GDP.
So you can see, Germany's debt to GDP is a little over 60%.
The U.S. is living in this 120% 130% range.
You see Japan all the way at the right over there at almost 240%.
Okay, so that's debt to GDP.
And mind you guys, why is this important?
Debt to GDP is how much debt, how much of their populist future has a sovereign has a country borrowed.
First, how much growth are they producing to pay it back?
Why is that relevant?
Why is that matter so much?
Well, think about it.
When you borrow money, what matters is growth that you're producing to pay it back.
You only borrow from your future if you theoretically could spend that capital today
and arrive in the future with more resources than if you didn't.
Let me give you a super layman's example.
Five-year-old boroughs, $100 for a lemonade stand.
And the expectation is they'll produce enough growth selling lemonade
that they'll be able to pay back the $100 plus proceeds for themselves, right?
And so what you would want to know is debt to GDP for the five-year-olds lemonade stand is
how much debt to they take $100 versus how much growth are they producing to pay that back?
Now you take that to the United States or to Japan or to Germany.
How much debt versus the GDP, what's that ratio?
And when you get to over 100% if you get to 120% Japan's well over 200%.
That's interesting.
Now, the Y-Axis is debt services as a percentage of GDP.
So how much does it cost to service the debt as a percentage of your growth?
Now, when you use the bond market, you can actually get a sense of how markets are judging this.
And so when you look at the light bubbles that shows a projection 10 years out using the 10-year-ten-year
markets, it shows that Japan is pricing 11% debt service as a percentage of GDP.
That's insane. That means well over 10% that service as a percent of their GDP.
That's unbelievable. It shows the United States as over 6%.
At 7%. And what this image shows is that if you look at the diagonal lines,
the higher the rates go, the faster your growth.
You see? So this image, you screenshot this and you should read the financial times article.
This goes to show and read the title of this, if forward markets are a guide to the future,
debt services is set to explode. It's not making a speculative prediction.
It's taking forward market, so the 10-year-ten year, forward projecting to 10 or to 2036 using that,
and saying as a percent of GDP, none of this is sustainable. And this is a very like,
in my opinion, an interesting way, because usually you don't have debt-to-GDP rates and debt-service
percent of GDP in one chart. So it was able to create a visual out of all of those and basically show
us that we are reaching sovereign crisis levels of debt, like Japan. And if you look at Japan
all the way on the right and the forward projection of 11%. I mean, that's outrageous. That's outrageous.
Oh, let me zoom this back out. And so here I go, showing the same asset, probably for the third week
in a row, which is the US 10-year over the Japanese 10-year and the US dollar over the Japanese
and the title of my slide, EM style stress signal, JGB yields are up and the yen is down.
That is emergent market behavior. This is not good. This is really, really bad. The gap between
that red line and that blue line is the biggest story in macro economics right now. The biggest story.
By far. By far. So interesting, this, I got this from Luke Grom and Shadaluk, just the best
in the game, honestly. This title, Japan, was the only exception. So, mind you, this from Hershman
capital, okay? I'm going to read the graphic here. Government default seems unavoidable.
It reads, since 1800, 51 out of 52 countries with gross government debt greater than 130%
have defaulted, either through restructuring, devaluation, high inflation, or an outright default.
Examples are shown in the end note. The IMF expects the US government debt to GDP to be a record
141% by year end 2020. There is little reason the US government should not also default, okay?
In the end notes, it has this visual, which I've shown on the right here, and it has a footnote
that says, present-day Japan is the only example of a country avoiding default, despite having
government debt greater than 130% of GDP. However, as discussed in our year end 2016 letter,
a Japanese default seems inevitable. And Japan was always used from Keynesian economics or modern-day
economists like all these fiat maxis. It was always used as an excuse. Well, look at Japan.
Japan's debt to GDP's over 200% it hasn't defaulted. And it was always such a load of shit.
Obviously, anyone with a brain and that can think logically with first principles knows
that you cannot just borrow from your future forever, especially without producing the growth
to pay it back. That's a perpetual motion machine, that's a Ponzi scheme. All of us logically
are aware of that. It takes, I don't know, a teenager's developed brain to understand that.
How we have economists teaching at universities, the opposite of that. It's always mind-boggling to me.
But the point of this is now Japan's no longer an exception. It's no longer an excuse. And every
single country that's debt to GDP gets out of control, they default. The United States is at
these levels. Japan is long over those levels. So, again, why am what's the context? Guys,
we are living through a sovereign debt crisis. Like, we're in the middle of it. So, Japan can
protect itself by selling the United States. And this is another topic. Again, I could have made
this episode three hours long. But these are topics I've gone over in recent episodes. So,
trying to keep this one tight. But Joseph Wang writes, Japan looks to be in a crack-up boom.
A fiat regime has no risk of a bond crisis. And rising JGB yields simply reflect rising policy
expectations. And FX crisis is possible, but Japan can manage that with its large foreign
asset holdings. I want to break this down and say it in Jack language. So, a fiat regime has
no risk of a bond crisis. Why is he saying that? Well, a bond crisis is a crisis of lending to the
government, right? As we've talked about in previous episodes recently, a bond is just way to lend
to the sovereign, lend to the government, to the Japanese government, to the US government.
So, when he says a fiat regime has no risk of a bond crisis, he's saying a fiat regime can just
print money. So, if no one will lend to the government, the central bank can always just print
the money out of thin air and lend it to the government. Now, you're solving a problem while creating
another one. The other one you're creating is that's highly inflationary, obviously. It's severely
debases the currency just by creating money out of thin air. But his point is, there is no bond
crisis for these sovereigns. At the end of the day, there are fiat regime, so they can just print
what they want. And so he says, a fiat regime has no risk of a bond crisis. Okay, we understand that.
And rising JGB yields simply reflect rising policy expectations. In fx crisis is possible. So,
as we've been talking about, yields have gone up, but the currency has gone down. That's an emerging
market crisis. Now, that is an issue. And what he's saying is, a bond crisis can be solved by
printing money out of thin air. What printing money out of thin air does not solve is a currency
crisis, an fx crisis. Printing more yen only weakens the yen. And he says, but Japan can
manage that by selling its large foreign holdings. And this is what we've been talking about.
Over and over and over and over is Japan is one of the largest asset holders in the world.
They own a tremendous amount of the United States of America. And so the reason that the United
States has wanted to step in, provide them a dollar swap line, bail out Japan, be involved
in their markets. So I've talked about before. We're America. Why the hell do we care about Japan
that much? If they have issues, they have issues. It's not like we wish them to have issues. But
if they have issues like why does a matter I live in Chicago? Well, the reason is because if
Japan wanted to protect its currency, so let's say this, Japan bonds get out of control
and the Japanese central bank needs to print money out of thin air to lend it to the government
to protect the bond market. Okay, fine. Now the currency that's already getting hammered is
going to get hammered more. Okay. How do they protect the currency? Well, all the assets that they have,
they can sell them to bid up their own currency. Basically, to plead their reserves,
think of this as a giant, like they have all these reserves backing this Ponzi scheme. And
now the Ponzi scheme is getting margin called so they're going to deplete their reserves.
It's like the Luna Ponzi scheme of 2022. So they're going to deplete their reserves to try and
protect it. Well, what do their reserves? Their reserves are mag seven. Their reserves are U.S.
Treasuries. Their reserves are U.S. assets. Right? And so this is the Japan sneezes and the U.S.
Treasury market gets the flu. Why this is why the United States cares? This is why this is such
a global issue and not just an issue for Japan. It's because if Japan is under stress,
then the U.S. Treasury market will start to disfunction or and slash or the U.S. stock market
will start to disfunction. And it doesn't matter if the U.S. Treasury market initially is okay.
As soon as the U.S. stock market starts to sell off again, the U.S. needs their tax receipts.
They need assets to deliver capital gains. They need employment to remain healthy. Or else,
they cannot afford their own debt servicing. So Japan gets stressed. U.S. Treasury starts
disfunction. Yields go up. Risk comes off. Bitcoin comes down. And that's this array. This is the
domino of events. And like we've talked about before in the last episode in particular,
unfortunately Bitcoin is bucketed in this risk on. It's bucketed like it's a technology software
stock. And I would assume everyone listening the show thinks of it like hard money. Has monetized
it like hard money treats it as a savings account. And eventually, as Bitcoin, the people holding it
for what I think are the wrong reasons that because they think it's like owning mag seven,
like a tech stock, they're getting washed out. And over time, Bitcoin continues to be capitalized
and held by what are called hotlers of last resort, right? Those that monetize it, those
that save in it. And so slowly, but surely, my expectation is Bitcoin decouples itself from
trading like a tech stock and starts to behave and act more like gold. But it's going to have to
mature for that. It's going to need a larger market cap. It's still not big enough for sovereigns,
for central banks, for, you know, endowments even to allocate in large size. A 1.3 trillion dollar
asset is just not big enough. It's like the size of Tesla. Okay. And the people, a large portion
of people that do hold it are unfortunately, you know, they are getting crushed right now because
software is getting crushed because max seven is getting crushed because there's a capital rotation
in the gold. And part of them getting crushed is Bitcoin's getting crushed because they've been
holders of Bitcoin. So that's why Japan matters, you know, for the novice and I don't blame them,
they're like, okay, cool, like Tokyo's fucked. Why do I care? Well, this whole fiat thing is one
giant chain of Ponzi scheme. That's that's why you care. So what's my evidence here?
Look at the mag seven. This tweet from Charlie, all seven members of the magnificent seven are
now down on the year and underperforming the S&P 500. So I've talked about, I think something's
brewing. Job revisions look really bad. Consumer confidence looks really bad. Consumer sentiment
looks really bad. Mag seven looks really bad. Bitcoin looks really bad. It's a matter of time before
the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 take a tumble. I think that I think something like liberation day
or worse is coming. I do. And I think Bitcoin is going to bleed until they print the money.
Now, the way this ends is they're going to print the money, right? I mean, we've talked about this.
It's either going to be a hard default or a soft default. A hard default is they, the United
States just comes out and says, we give up everything's over. We're defaulting. The world's
going to fall apart. They could have done that over the last decades. They haven't. Instead,
they've printed the money, which is a soft default. A soft default is defaulting via inflation.
If you print enough money, paying back $40 trillion is not that hard because a dollar is worthless.
You know, we could afford paying back $40 trillion Venezuelan boulevard because of Venezuelan boulevard
literally worth less than the toilet paper that wipes my ass. So if you keep printing the dollar,
then you're effectively defaulting via inflation in the basement of the currency. And so what's
my evidence that this is playing out is Max Evans getting absolutely hammered. Microsoft,
down 17% Amazon, down 14% Tesla, down Apple, down meta, Google, and video. I mean, it's bad. It's bad.
And then if you look at the Max Evans over gold, I mean, it looks really bad. It's about to make
new lows. And it's clear that capital is rotating into gold. And what does that mean, guys?
Capital rotating from where into gold, from sovereign paper, from sovereign debt. So the era of
saving in sovereign debt is dead. We are entering a sovereign debt crisis, sovereign debt capital,
these these treasuries, these paper notes from governments are rotating into gold.
Why not Bitcoin? I've said Bitcoin's just not big enough. It's just not not mature enough yet.
And that's fine. Like it's all about your time preference. And it's all about why you're here.
I'm 31 years old. I firmly believe gold has already failed us. It's going to fail us again if we
let it. We've engineered a better solution, but it's going to take a lot of man hours and a lot of
conviction and a lot of leadership to lead us to the glory days of Bitcoin. We got to put our head
down and get to work. And I'm young enough where I hope God willing knock on wood that I can be alive
for the coming decades to see that through for future generations for my kids. So I'm not where
I got nothing but time. As long as I eat my rib eyes, get some sun, exercise, take care of my body.
I got nothing but time. But the reality is Bitcoin's just not big enough. A trillion dollar asset
can't absorb central bank buying. It can't try not ran a trillion plus dollar trade surplus last year.
They can't pour their trade surplus into Bitcoin. Their trade surplus this year might be bigger
than Bitcoin's entire market cap. So when you look at Bitcoin versus gold, it looks like
max seven versus gold. It looks like tech versus gold. Gold is absorbing the largest market
in the world, which is the bond market, the treasury market. And Bitcoin is behaving like a
tech stock, which, by the way, I don't want to be too negative. Bitcoin's going to outperform
once they print the money. Just to be clear, my like one sentence prediction. The next one to do
quarters are probably going to be really volatile and potentially a crisis. And then they print the
money and then we're off to the races, Bitcoin's the best performing thing. And so to me, it's time
to turn on your DCAs. It's time to buy the fucking dip. Buy the tech guys dips. These tech hedge
fun guys are getting margin called tech is getting murdered and buy their dip.
Hodler's the last resort, the sovereign individuals, buy their dip. But that's, I mean,
what's happening in Japan is the largest story in macro economics, bar none. It's not close.
It is a debt crisis playing out in real time. And if the Japanese currency needs help,
they're going to have to sell all their U.S. assets. If they sell their U.S. assets, they're
going to cause a crisis. And so the question is not if there will be a crisis, it's when there
will be a crisis in when authorities will step in. That's the question. Are they going to step in
before the crisis? They usually don't. They usually let their be paying so that they have political
cover. If, think about it, if Janet Yellen printed all that money before Silicon Valley Bank
fell apart, there'd been like, what the hell? We were on the back half of all this inflation,
Bokyu, Janet Yellen. But because banks are falling apart and people were literally going to
the bank and saying, I want my money and they're saying, your money's not here, then she has the
political cover to print the money and be a hero. So I expect, I expect things to get dicey. I really
do. And on top of that, let's get into AI and how it's accelerating because it's one thing to have
a sovereign debt crisis in Japan, effectively foreshadowing what's going to happen to the United
States and for central banks and sovereigns to be rotating out of government paper and into gold.
It's an entirely other thing for this AI thing, which is one of the most deflationary inventions
of our lifetime to be accelerating at the pace that it is. So chapter two, AI is accelerating
in debt systems hate deflation. Okay, this guy Matt Schumer, he wrote this piece, I mean,
look at the screenshot. As of today, at 83 million views on Twitter, it's titled something
big is happening. I'm going to get close to my screen here and just read it a little story time
for the kids at home. Trust me, it'll be worth it. So he writes, think back to February 2020.
If you were paying close attention, you might have noticed a few people talking about a virus
spreading overseas, but most of us weren't paying close attention. The stock market was doing great,
your kids were in school, you were going to restaurants and shaking hands and planning trips.
If someone told you they were stockpiling toilet paper, you would have thought they'd be spending
too much time in the weird corner of the internet. Then over the course of about three weeks,
the entire world changed, your office closed, your kids came home and life rearranged itself into
something you wouldn't have believed if you described it to yourself a month earlier. I think
we're in the this seems overblown phase of something much, much bigger than COVID. I spent six
years building an AI startup and investing in the space. I live in this world. In I'm writing
this for the people in my life who don't. My family, my friends and the people I care about,
who keep asking me, so what's the deal with AI? And getting an answer that doesn't do just
this what's actually happening. I keep giving them the polite version, the cocktail party version,
because the honest version sounds like I've lost my mind. And for a while, I told myself that was
good enough reason to keep what's truly happening to myself. But the gap between what I've been
saying and what is actually happening has gotten far too big. The people I care about,
deserve to hear what is coming, even if it sounds crazy. I should be clear about something up front.
Even though I work in AI, I have almost no influence over what's about to happen and neither does
the vast majority of our industry. The future is being shaped by a remarkably small number of people,
a few hundred researchers at a handful of companies, open AI, anthropic, Google DeepMind and a
few others. A single training run managed by a small team of over a few months can produce an AI
system that shifts the entire trajectory of technology. Most of us who work in AI are building
on top of foundations that we did not lay. We're watching this unfold the same as you. We just
happen to be close enough to feel the ground shake first. But it's time now, not in an eventually
we should talk way. In a, this is happening right now and I need you to understand it way.
Then the next page and this is the last page I'll read. I know this is real because it happened to me
first. Here's the thing nobody outside of tech quite understands yet. The reason so many people in
the industry are sounding the alarm right now is because this already happened to us. We're not
making predictions. We're telling you what already occurred in our own jobs in warning you that
you're next. For years, AI had been improving steadily. Big jumps here and there. But each jump
was spaced out enough so that you could absorb them as they came. Then in 2025, new techniques
for building these models unlocked a much faster pace of progress and then it got even faster and
then faster again. Each new model wasn't just better than the last. It was better by a wide
margin and the time between new model releases was shorter. I was using AI more and more and more
going back and forth with it less and less and less watching it handle things. I used to think
required my expertise. Then on February 5th, two major AI labs released new models on the same day.
GPT 5.3 codex from OpenAI and Opus 4.8 from Anthropic, the makers of Claude, one of the main
competitors to chat to you. And something clicked. Not like a light switch. More like the moment you
realize the water has been rising around you and now is at your chest. I am no longer needed for the
actual technical work of my job. I described what I want built in, plain English and it just appears.
Not a rough draft of my computer for hours and I come, excuse me. Not a rough draft. I need to
fix the finished thing. I tell the AI what I want. I walk away from my computer for four hours and
I come back to find the work done and it's done well. Done better than I would have done it myself
with no corrections needed. A couple of months ago I was going back and forth with the AI guiding the
AI making edits to the AI. Now I just describe the outcome and I leave. Let me give you an example
so you can understand what this actually looks like in practice. I'll tell the AI I want this app built.
Here's what it should do. Here's roughly what it should look like. Figure out the user flow,
the design all of it and it does it. It writes tens of thousands of lines of code. Then
and this is the part that would have been unthinkable years ago. It opens the app itself. It
clicks through the app with buttons. It tests the features. It uses the app the same way a person
would use the app. If it doesn't like how it does something or how it feels, it goes back and
then changes it by itself. It iterates like a developer would fixing and refining until it's satisfied.
Only once it has decided that the app meets its own standards does it come back to me and say
it's ready for you to test. And when I test it it's usually perfect. I'm not exaggerating. This is
what my Monday looked like this week. Okay guys, I'm going to give you a live example because
this is exactly how I use AI and in fact how I built this. This guy is telling the truth. The CTO
of strike hasn't written a line of code in forever. Our CTO Tom has not written code in a really long
time. Now we're still like AI is rapidly changing our company and we already are one of the highest
velocity Bitcoin companies in the world and we're only going to get more efficient. It's actually
insane. Now I will just make an example. So the way I have AI set up, I have a developer environment
that builds all my slide decks, my board decks, my Jack Mallorse show decks, my presentations for
conferences, internal ideas I have. So here I will say create a new title slide after slide 22 and
let's make the title live example of AI and the subtitle should be this is mind blowing
deflation meets inflation. So I just talked to my computer and it's off working and what I've
increasingly done is I'm allowed to read a lot more research. I do spend a decent amount. I spend
about a thousand bucks on my personal AI setup. I use cloud for engineering. I use open AI for research
and going back and forth on ideas. I use Gemini which is Google's for imagery and video creation
and then there's one more tool I use which is an AI that is a browser extension and on my phone
that reads to me anybody of text. It's unbelievable. So if someone writes a blog or someone writes a
tweet storm or whatever it allows me to walk around Chicago, go for walks be outside and I can
consume research like someone's reading me a book but it could be anything on the internet. So I
literally just have wired headphones in my ears. I walk around Chicago, get fresh air, sit in the
park places that kind of inspire me and I just listen to research and listen to ideas and then
when I want to build something I just talk to my computer. I will just pull out my phone and say hey
tell my computer to build these slides. So anyways let's check back in on my so it created it so I'm
going to refresh my deck and here's the slide it just made. Live example of AI this is mind-blowing
deflation meets inflation. It just made that slide because I just talked to it. So the presentation
you guys are seeing is I just talked to my computer. I say here's all the data. Here the
images and the screenshots that I created I have a folder on my computer and like here's all the
stuff make it and I go walk to the grocery store listen to more research I come back and I go back
and forth with it a little bit. It's insane. It's fucking insane. So we go on from Axios AI Insiders
are sounding the alarm. A lot of insiders and executives at these AI companies have started to quit
because of how powerful this stuff is getting and where they think the world is going. On the right
it reads the assertion that disruptive AI does not require artificial general intelligence so
AGI but rather good enough technology deployed at scale highlights a critical often overlooked reality.
Industrial disruption is driven by cost speed and ubiquity not just peak human level capability.
So the point is people are starting to realize we don't need AGI to disrupt the world. All we need
is the tools that are exist today at scale. Like I'm telling you I'm developing software with my
mouth. I'm not I don't ever touch my keyboard. In here's the thing let me say and I've said this
before in prior episodes but I feel it's important to reiterate I don't find this dystopian.
You know you really are if it's you are what you want to be. If you want to be a victim be a victim.
You have every excuse to be a victim. You could say oh the phones and our pocket and the social
media networks and the AI it's so dystopian and I miss the world where everyone had more human
interaction blah blah blah blah blah. Sure you want to be a victim. You could be a victim
no one stopping you. Do you have plenty of excuses to be a victim and pout like a little baby?
You could also be empowered. What is AI? AI is bringing down the marginal cost of intelligence.
The marginal cost of software. The marginal cost of being an accountant, medical, lawyer. So
legal, medical, finance, intelligence and software. The core five things that you need to achieve
anything in your life are worth effectively zero or as close to zero as they'll ever be.
And what's left? What's left is the creative expression of being human.
So I've said many times and I'll do a presentation at some point maybe the next conference I go to
and long forum. I expect Bitcoin and AI to usher in a new art Renaissance because if you have the
money that you can actually save that can't be debased because the problem today is
you know, a doctor is only spending 50% of his or her time focusing on being a doctor and
they're spending the other 50% percent of their time being a speculator because they have to be.
If you're being compensated in a currency that's being debased and you're living through highly
inflationary times because of fiat then you have to download Robinhood, punt on stocks,
understand central bank monetary policy, try and listen to this show and understand what the
fuck is going on instead of just division of labor and focusing on your craft.
And so for one Bitcoin will allow us to be more future oriented, lower our time preference,
not spend our time panicking and speculating like a bunch of gamblers and become savers.
And then AI will remove our need to do white collar mundane labor.
You don't have to do all the accounting work. You don't have to do all the manual nursing work.
You don't have to write all the legal documents. You don't have to write all the software.
You get to be the creator, the artist. I think AI empowers the artist and I've said this before.
I consider my job largely in art. I mean, what do I do for a living? Whether it's podcasts,
whether it's tweets, whether it's products, whether it's companies, whether it's TV segments.
I'm trying to convey information. I'm trying to relate to people. I'm trying to inspire people.
I'm trying to revolutionize a group of people towards a better world. It's an art.
How to connect with you guys? How to relay information? How to inspire? How to galvanize?
How to encourage? It's an art. An AI has made me a better artist.
I mean, I can do keynotes used to take me months to prepare and they were painful. I was like putting
an artist in the studio and forcing them to record an album. It was painful. How do I inspire
myself? You go back and forth and one good idea took me days in slide format to puke out.
Then I realized I hated it and I have to scrap it and start over.
Now it's made me such a better artist. It's easier to express myself. It's easier to explore
and the marginal cost for me to get more intelligence, get more engineering. It's like nothing.
I'm paying 1,000 bucks a month for all my AI accounts and I don't touch my keyboard anymore.
It's fucking crazy and I run two massive companies. It's crazy. Anyway, so
this from the Microsoft AI CEO, he said, I mean, this is crazy. Most if not all professional tasks
for lawyers, accountants, project managers and marketing professionals will be fully automated
by AI within the next 12 to 18 months. Here's a thing. If that's true, then there is a crisis
brewing. The level of unemployment is insane. Here's the thing, guys. You say, well, why is that such
a big deal? What if everyone went to the park and ate butterfingers all day? Why is that a problem?
Well, the problem is, all of these people have credit cards, have mortgages, have car notes,
have student debt. We live in a fiat world. We live in a debt-based monetary system. How are they
going to pay that back? And if no one has a job and all of the jobs are done by a robot,
well, then who's paying taxes to the government to service its 40 trillion dollars of debt?
So if the government has no more tax receipts to service its debt, the point is there's just
loads and loads and loads of debt. And the loads and loads of debt are presumably being paid back
by siphoning off our time and energy. We get up, we go to work, the government takes that from us
to service its debt. And if everyone's like, oh, well, my AI does everything I need and it's bringing
the cost of everything down. I actually don't need that much money to service a lifestyle.
Well, then we're going in an extreme sovereign debt crisis because everyone's unemployed.
So, again, crisis. And I'll get, I won't front-round myself, let me just get through these slides.
So, had research of adanthropic also resigned and you guys should go to this tweet. I won't read this one,
but it's, it's crazy. He's like, I will read one part. I'll read the third paragraph.
Nevertheless, it is clear to me that the time has come to move on. I continuously find myself
reckoning with our situation. The world is in peril and not just from AI or bioweapons,
but from a whole series of interconnected crisis unfolding in this very moment. We appear to be approaching
a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world.
Last, we face the consequences. Moreover, throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen
how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions. I've seen this within myself
within the organization where we constantly face pressure to set aside what matters most
and throughout broader society too. So, these AI leaders are having like existential crisis.
This guy writes this note, which basically says he's going to go move to the UK and write poems
in pursue creative artistry and disappear.
Anyways, back to what you guys care about, debt system needs jobs. So, this visual is just,
it's just a fact. This is true interest expense as a percentage of US tax receipts. So, it's
tax receipts meaning they're collecting taxes from the people via capital gains. So, assets go up,
people sell those assets to do stuff in the economy and they take capital gain tax receipts from
income. So, the core tax receipts drive inability to cover the true interest expense. And you can
see US true interest expense as a percentage US tax receipts rise. Half of hours, so I have
on the bottom left there, 50 percent, half of our receipts are tied to employment. So, AI pressures
the base of this pyramid. It's starting to become very fragile. If in 12 to 18 months, all white
collar is eviscerated, entirely disrupted, then the pyramid that the United States has built
is fallen apart completely. And stress shows up in consumers. I write elite over production is
causing societal stress. So, delinquency is arising. And if AI is disrupting, then delinquency
is not an early tell that this is already happening. I've talked about elite over production
from the book The End Times, but I will just read the screenshot from Wikipedia to remind you guys.
Elite over production is a concept developed by Peter Turchin that describes the condition of a society
that has an excess supply of potential elite members relative to its ability to absorb them
into the power structure. This he hypothesizes is a cause for social instability.
So, the whole thesis is that a collapsing empire, okay. There are two core KPIs that show.
It's about collapse or is collapsing. One is real wage growth. So, when wage growth starts
decline in real terms so that people's salaries are getting them less groceries,
affording them less family, less housing, less energy, less vacations, less everything.
That causes societal distress as people are working harder and getting less, okay. And the
other is this concept of elite over production, which is extremely fascinating because what he describes
as elite are university educated people that want to be Wall Street hedge fund managers, want to be
tech CEOs, want to be rising star politicians. And the problem is not everyone can be that.
Now, it sounds crazy me saying that as a 31 year old in the United States because everyone my age
thinks that's what life is all about. Why? Because there is no blue collar work. There is no manual
label labor work. If you don't have a university degree, you're poor and you have no future life.
According to anyone in the dense populace of the United States, if they like, that's just been
our reality. All of the manual labor jobs, like if you know mining rare earths in the United
States paid you as much as a Google engineer, then I'm sure that people would say ask,
screw it, I'm good on going to university. I'll just get my hands dirty, mind some rare earths and
make a living. But that's just not there is no such thing. And so what you have is everyone is forced
into university degrees. You have this concept of elite over production where everyone is aspiring
for positions in society, there aren't enough of them. So what you get is these are typically
who are the revolutionaries. These youthful, well educated, well articulate, well coordinated
group of people, and up saying, fuck this system. What a sick joke convinced me to get up to my
eyeballs in debt. I've got a mortgage, I've got student debt, I've got a car node, I've got credit card
debt, all for me to get fired because Elon's robots took my job. Fuck this socialism. That is
elite over production. And elite over production is a result of all this fiat garbage. No blue collar
jobs. And then a deflationary technology should be good for all of us. A deflationary technology
should bring the price down of everything that we want to consume. And it has for me,
my life is amazing because of AI. I'm a far better artist, a far better podcast or a far better CEO,
far better everything. But I mean, I mean, these are the, in mind you, I don't want to get too
dark, but who I just described, these like university educated, but disenfranchised, you know,
people, these are also the people that have been picking up guns and shooting people, right?
I mean, anyway, we move on. So this is how AI leads to money printing, what I've been
talking about. So AI is disruption. That leads to employment numbers coming down, which we now have
officially seen. The revised numbers for 2025 over 1 million. That's outrageous, which brings the
government's tax receipts down, which brings our debt stress up as a country, which brings market
stress up markets crash. And that's when they print the money. So I would say we are somewhere along
this line. We are not at the money printing yet, but we are probably like three to six months
from the money printing. I would say we're one to two quarters from the money printing. If I had to
guess, I mean, listen, I know one knows the future. I'm wrong all the time. So, you know, don't get
a tattoo on your forehead. But this is how this is the dominoes. So we went through the dominoes
of how Japan causes a market crash. And this is how AI causes a market crash. And when you
have them both at the same time, you start getting Bitcoin flying to the downside and sending
a warning shot, a liquidity smoke alarm across everyone's computer screen. You see the Mag7
getting absolutely hammered. It explains why gold is catching a bid and sovereign paper is getting
rotated out of. I mean, I think a crisis is brewing. And so to end it, Bitcoin's the liquidity
thermometer deflation first print later. So where are we with Bitcoin? We're at the turn on your
DCA's guys. You know, I expect Bitcoin to make another low. Can it come lower than what's our
low recently? 60k? I don't even know something like that. Can it go lower? Yeah, 100%. Will it? I have
no idea. What I look at, I look at a certain set of charts and data to give me a sense of, you know,
what you want, lows are rarely made like in a flash instance. And I'm not talking about like the
literal low. I'm talking about the general chapter of the bear market. For me, it's turn on your DCA's.
You know, I never have the expectation that I'm going to pick off the Pico bottom, right? Of course.
For me, it's how can I, you know, what can I sell in my life? Like, I'm actively looking around,
like, what can I sell? How can I get some liquidity for myself and turn on the DCA's?
Turn all my paychecks come into strike. They get converted into Bitcoin, turn on my DCA's. And so
Bitcoin and VRV at 0.5. Traditionally, the absolute bottoms are when that reaches below zero.
So we're getting really, really close. Only 5.3% of days have seen the Bitcoin mayor
multiple at a lower level. So yes, Bitcoin price can go lower. But again, at what point you turn
on your DCA and start stacking sacks? I mean, I think now is that time. And this one was really
interesting. This is the business cycle in the liquidity cycles paired with Bitcoin. And it's
point is liquidity right now is not abundant. Liquidity is stressed. The business cycle, we really
main street has been in a recession since liberation week, basically, or even before that,
is the point and that it's starting to turn up again. And the economy is starting to get hot.
GDP numbers, economic numbers are actually looking really good. And so it's saying that Bitcoin
is probably bottoming out if you look at its history and its relationships to the business cycle.
So where are we at with Bitcoin? I think you've got, I don't know, weeks to months to turn on a DCA
and get Bitcoin at extremely, relatively cheap prices before big printing comes because of
some crisis, because of some crisis. Okay. I'm excited for this section. Hold on, I got a message.
It might be from Dylan. Nope. I think Dylan's off today. Okay. So I don't know, so this is
a new section of the show. So bear with me here. I think it sounded funny. So you guys, here's my
pitch on the section. But let me know the feedback in the chat in the comments. You guys seem to like
when I go on these like rants. Someone asks a question in the chat and I think it's stupid and I just
go off and I start cursing and getting all fired up. And you guys seem to think that's hilarious.
And so it reminded me of I grew up a family guy, kid. So you know, growing up in my house,
my dad and I would always watch family guy. And it reminded me of Peter Griffin had this segment
and family guy called Grind My Gears. I'll just play the first bit of this clip here. Shout out
to all the family guy fans out there. I was a huge family guy, kid. Yeah, save your money,
talk it. His place doesn't have porn. They think it's a moral. You know, it really grunts my
gears. We're exactly in the Bible. Does it say a man can't fire off some knuckles children in
the privacy of his own neighbors living room while his neighbors at work because I don't have a
DVD player? Well, I don't know where it says it because the Bible is way too long to read.
Hey, that was quite a rant there. You know, we're looking for an every man to rant about petty
non-sensical irritants to replace our spotlight on the Middle East segment. In other news, after several
growing days of frightening uncertainty, I finally get my period. Well, I am sure you and your brother
must be devastated by the loss of the two headed offspring that might have been. We now go to Peter
Greffen for you know what really grinds my gears. Thanks, Tom. You know what really grinds my gears?
Nobody's come up with a new priest in a rabbi joke in like 30 years, you know? I mean, okay,
yeah, priest in a rabbi go into the supermarket and the priest wants to buy a ham and a rabbi says,
I can't eat it. It's forbidden. Couldn't eat it. Not a lot. Pigs are like superheroes to them.
Is it perfect? No, but I don't see you coming up with anything. And that people is what grinds my
gears. Okay. So whatever. It reminds me of this family guy section where Peter ends up going on the
news and having a news segment called, you know, it really grinds my gears. And so I figured I would
have my own version of that. So welcome to the first ever, first ever, what really grinds my gears,
where I pick a few things over the last week that really grinds my gears and just rant about it.
And you guys give me feedback. Let me know if you think that this is funny. But some things really
piss me off. And I'm always ranting to Dylan about it. And when I was reading the comments section,
I was like, honestly, I might as well make a segment out of this. Okay. You know what really grinds my
gears? The people that tell you how to use Bitcoin. And they, sorry, this is not a kid friendly
version of the show. Kids time to leave and go to bad parents time to turn the show off if you
got your kids listening because, you know, when I start to get going, the curse words fly. I'm sorry.
Sorry, not sorry. Okay. You know, it grinds my gears is the people that bitch and moan and complain
that you're not using Bitcoin, how they want you to use Bitcoin. So this, I got tagged in a million
times. The text is really small. Let's see if I can zoom in here. This, we are not winning, but we can.
If we want to win, we have to fight and ridicule custodial exchanges, stable coins, ETFs,
treasury companies, and Bitcoin back loans. All of these things are the opposite of the vision that
the cipherpunks are founding fathers made. The United States of America is where it is today because
Americans forgot the vision of its founders and the constitution. And it goes on to just bitch
and moan and complain. I don't like the way you're using Bitcoin. You shouldn't be using loans.
You shouldn't be using, it's like, oh my god, shut the fuck up. It's so insane to me that the
self declared libertarians and self-sovereign people that believe fundamentally in property rights
get so wound up to tell other people how to use their property. Here's the thing, guys. Bitcoin
uniquely enables anyone to do what they want. Including, I can't send gold to the other side of the
world without depositing it to a central party, without trusting a central party. That's why
gold failed gold failed because it can't scale to an internet economy because I got a deposit
it to a bank to a government to a central bank in order for me to send it on the internet. Bitcoin
allows you to hold itself custodially to move it without the permission of anyone else. But if you
want to deposit it on an exchange, get a loan. Of course you're allowed to do whatever the fuck
you want. It's the equivalent of, I don't like the way that you're using your house. Well guess what,
it's my fucking house. I don't give a shit what you think about how I use my house. It's my house.
It's my property. Shut the fuck up. Do us all a favor and stop whining and complaining.
Here's the other thing. If creating an ETF or someone creating a custodial exchange or someone
offering a Bitcoin back loan was the death of Bitcoin, then Bitcoin was never destined to succeed
in the first place. If enough people do not want to protect the core principles of Bitcoin and
what makes it valuable, then Bitcoin's going to fail. And I'm not saying people shouldn't advocate
for what they believe in. There's a huge difference between, hey, I believe self-custity is important.
I believe in holding your own keys. Which I think that's, first of all, I'm quoting myself. We say
this, it's strike all that I don't want to any Bitcoin on our platform. But to just bitch and moan
and complain, every time I open my social media mentions and it's like, hey Jack, take a look at
this, read this. Oh yeah, thanks, bright guy. I started and run to the biggest Bitcoin companies in the
world, but it wasn't until you dropped a mention in my Nostor mentions for me to read. Oh, thank
you. Get a fucking grip. Seriously, it grinds my gears to no end. On what planet do you have the
right to tell people how to use their property? Bitcoin is money for everyone. It drives me nuts all
day. People tweet at me. I don't like the way you're using Bitcoin. I don't like the way. I don't like
that black rock as an ETF. I really, I really bothers me. Shot the fuck up. Shot the fuck. Shot up.
Use Bitcoin, however you want to use Bitcoin as long as you're following the consensus rules
and we're advocating and maintaining the core principles of the asset. If someone wants to take
a loan against Bitcoin, people say, Jack, why don't you spend your Bitcoin? Because where I live,
they don't accept Bitcoin. Shot the fuck up. Oh, drives me nuts. It's so, it's so antithesis
of the whole point of Bitcoin. The whole point of Bitcoin is property rights for everyone.
I do what I want with my property. I would never tell someone. I don't like the way that you use your
kitchen. I don't like the way that you use your house. It's not my house. Why would I give a fuck?
How someone else uses their property? It drives me nuts. It does. Guess what? Bitcoin
back loans have changed my life. They've allowed me to acquire more Bitcoin than I otherwise
would have acquired and I've sold less Bitcoin than I otherwise have had to sell. Things like
the line of credit that we're about to roll out have changed my life. If you don't want to use it,
then just don't use it. You just complain and bitch and moan and then these people create enemies
out of people like me. Dude, hey, Jackass, I've never held a gun to your head and said you need to
use a loan or you need to use a custodial exchange. Do whatever you want. Do us all of favor and
shot the fuck up. Oh my god. It's so, it's ridiculous. Oh my god. These, these custodial exchanges
jack and strike and their Bitcoin loans. They're ruining Bitcoin and I just can't stand it. I just
want to cry and need a hug. Oh, shot the fuck up. Oh my god. Okay. Next episode of, you know,
it really grinds my gears. People that complain about our Bitcoin back lending product that don't
understand it. Okay. So this dude posted, so I put out an FYI that we had changed some of our terms
on our loan product to benefit the Bitcoiner. Okay. So we give you three days now to post collateral
once you're in a margin call and what people, people didn't even know, we don't fully liquidate
Bitcoin. If we need to liquidate some of your Bitcoin, we only liquidate enough to get you to a
healthy state. So we will never sell your entire Bitcoin collateral. We'll sell a tiny little portion
to get you back healthy. And so the combination of giving you more time and only selling a little
bit to get you back healthy allows the price to rebound and gives you time to either get more
collateral or for the price to get you back up. So it's a really good, good change and I post this FYI.
In this guy says, God of say, the worst narrative in this bear market has been that strike
and others are intentionally trying to steal users Bitcoin with this dump. If that was true,
they wouldn't operate this way. And I wrote, genuine question, do people actually believe this
to state the obvious? My business incentive is to keep the loan open for as long as possible.
I get paid servicing my customer, quote, taking their Bitcoin and quote onto my balance sheet
would be about the dumbest way imaginable for me to acquire Bitcoin. If I want to buy Bitcoin
at these levels, which I do every day, regardless of the price, I buy Bitcoin with our profit.
We don't lend out cash from our balance sheet because we don't want to own billions of dollars
of fiat. Strike owns as much Bitcoin as possible. We lend out fiat that we got from somebody
else. So when a loan gets liquidated, it's because I owe the cash back to someone who gave me the cash.
If the customer defaults, I have to sell the Bitcoin to get back the cash to the person that
let me the cash. So what do I want? What's my business incentive? I want Bitcoiners to have
healthy loans and never sell forever. I buy Bitcoin with the money I earn providing the service.
Da, you know what really grinds my gears? People that critique and yell about something they don't
understand. They say, wait, wait a second. You owe someone else fiat? Yes, you fucking idiot.
Here's how it works. I can't tell if this segment's going to be like really, really loves or
really, really hated. Whatever. Listen up, moron. Here's how it works. If someone wants a hundred
dollar loan, I borrow a hundred dollars from somebody else. I'm not lending out my own fiat because
I don't want billions of dollars of fiat. I'm the connector. I found I find people who want to
lend out fiat and I find Bitcoiners who want to borrow fiat and I connect to them and I have the
licenses and the platform and the risk management and all of that to provide the service. That's
what I do. So I borrow a hundred dollars from someone else and I lend you that hundred dollars and
I make money by let's say they charge me x percent and I charge x percent plus one. So I'm making one
percent for brokering and providing the service. So I have a collection of Bitcoiners that want
a borrow again, Bitcoin and I have a collection of fiat people that want to lend out fiat and
get a return. So if someone defaults on their loan, I have to sell the Bitcoin because I owe them
the hundred dollars. If, okay, I borrow a hundred dollars from somebody and I lend it to a Bitcoiner.
If the Bitcoiner never pays me back and they default, then I have to sell the Bitcoin because I owe
that guy a hundred dollars. To think that I'm stealing your Bitcoin, you are a fucking idiot. You
do not understand how this works. It's insane. And listen, I'm not being woe as me. It's, it's
man in the arena. It comes with the territory. Honestly, when Bitcoin gets in bear markets, people
hate me. You don't like the way I look. You don't like my hair. Got a haircut, though. You
guys tell? Ladies, keep it together. Whatever. You don't like the closet. You know, people get upset.
When the Bitcoin price is down, it's easier to blame the 31 year old in the empty closet that
you feel like you know than it is to blame yourself. And it's, it comes with the territory. It's fine.
I'm not complaining about that. But it really grinds my years. When people accuse me of being a
criminal or stealing people's Bitcoin, when they don't even know how the service works. In fact,
the way the service works, where one of the only services in the world that doesn't liquidate
all the Bitcoin, we liquidate a tiny fraction to keep you healthy. And we actually give you more
and more and more and more time. We're working with you to allow the price to rebound, rebound.
But I don't have, I can't, I have to pay back the person that I borrowed from in the first place.
So you don't really grinds my years. Is these people don't understand people will tweet at me and say,
dude, why are you liquidating at all? Hey, dumbass, because I have to,
grinds my years to no end. Oh, man. Oh, shit. Let's see if, uh, let's see if my AI can fix this slide.
It's too zoomed in or no, I zoomed in. There we go. Okay, last episode of, you know, it really grinds
my years today. You know what really grinds my years? Pam Bondi, this dumbass, who when asked about
Jeffrey Epstein, she said, well, the dials over 50k right now, the Nasdaq said all time highs, we should
be talking about that. Shut the fuck up. That is such, that is the most insane political statement.
I've ever heard. Hey, what about the most heinous black ring, uh, sex trafficking,
crime, what about the worst version of humanity is Epstein and everyone implicated in it. They've
the worst thing I've ever seen every single day that more of this shit comes out. I loot any
amount of trust. I had in any government, any central institution, any big corporation is evaporated.
It's the most heinous version of mankind ever. And when asked about that, you talk about the fucking
dial, shot the fuck up. And I, I quote, tweeted and I said, the stock market is only smashing record.
If you measure in dollars, mind you, the thing that she wants us to focus on is down against Bitcoin,
down against gold. It's down against all the things that the government can't print.
It's only smashing records in the things that the government can print because the government is printing
those things. You idiot. It was pew, watching this made me vomit. What an idiot. It's so pathetic.
This is such fourth turning. It's outrageous. If you want to revolutionize the youth, let me
tell you how you revolutionize the youth. Okay? People that are our age or younger or as we're
attempting to have kids, we're watching stories of people that are raping sexually abusing,
murdering young children, sex trafficking, young children. And these are the people that run the
products we use, run the government in the nation state that we live in, hiding secrets,
blackmailing each other. Mind you, all these kids, my age, are taking out debt up to their eyeballs,
and there's no jobs for them because of AI. So their currency's getting debased,
their unemployed, and they're living in a world where they're supposed to listen to rapist,
crime smuggling murders, liars. So, Pambandi, shut the fuck up.
And those are the three topics that really grind my gears this week. We'll see if you guys really
loved that segment or really hated it. But if you liked it, I'll take a few topics over the week
that just really grind my gears, and I'll just let loose. And by the way, you know,
I'm just busting balls on the internet. Okay? If you're one of the people that was shouting at me
and didn't understand how lending works, it's all love. Don't be a crybaby. You know,
don't throw stones into the glass house. I take my beatings to the chin, and we all move on.
It's okay. But it's all, it's all good fun. I'm just busting balls. That's a really
grandest my years. Okay. I told myself I'd keep the company updates fairly brief for strike.
New York. I'm still waiting on New York. So, I'm sorry, guys. It's not up to me at this point.
I reach out to New York. They said we're working on it. Everything is signed.
I'm not going to get into the process of the bitlisten, but it's like one final thumbs up is what
we're waiting on. And they said they're coming with it soon. And then the next big thing is
line of credit. We've got all sorts of stuff rolling out. So, for those in our paying attention,
we're almost in all the United States at this point. We got Texas last week, which was really,
really exciting. We're turning on businesses for California soon. So, looking forward to that.
And then the next two big product launches we have. We have our line of credit product
rolling out this month. So, over the coming weeks, really exciting. You know, one of the things
for people that want to live on Bitcoin with Bitcoin-backed loans, or just credit on top of Bitcoin,
you know, you might not want to take out a 12-month loan. Because then you got to take out a big chunk of cash.
And then you start getting worried about margin calls and liquidations. And what if the price goes this way?
Instead, if you can just, you know, a bill comes in to strike that you want to pay.
And it just extends a little line of credit. So, you're paying, you know, a couple thousand dollars
for the bills at a time. Your LTV super healthy. You're not having to take out a massive size loan all at once.
It's a far better user experience for people that don't need all that cash at once. They're not
financing a down payment. They're not financing a wedding. They're not financing an emergency.
They're just trying to live their life on their Bitcoin. And so, you know, that's how I live is
I've got my direct deposit goes into strike. I've got my bill pay hooked up to strike. And I've got
whatever some percentage of my Bitcoin stash that's not in cold storage. It's on strike. And it
collateralizes all the payments I need to make. So, if I want to go buy Bitcoin, I have a payment option
of I could buy it with a line of credit. So, I have my bank account or my line of credit. I want to pay a
bill. I can use my bank account, my Bitcoin balance or my line of credit. And so, in that way, my LTV is
super healthy because I'm only spending, like, a month's worth of bills against collateralized
against my Bitcoin and the one my paychecks come in, I can decide, hey, do I want to pay
some of this line of credit down? Or do I want to keep growing it? But then I'm not taking out like
one giant massive 12 month loan at a time. It's like a rolling line of credit and it enables
people to live on Bitcoin credit in a totally different user experience, which I'm very excited about.
And then after that, we'll be our yield on cash product. So, I'm very excited to, if you have cash
and you want a return on that cash, how I talked about the way our lending product works is I connect
people that want a return on their fiat with people that want to borrow against their Bitcoin.
That's ultimately the business we're in. And if you want to put your fiat in that pool,
so I can basically say, hey, you're going to get 67% 8% whatever we decide on your fiat dollars.
And then whatever you want to withdraw it, you withdraw it. But we're basically able to afford
you much more than a cash-sweet program getting the interest rates at the Fed sets because
Bitcoin back borrowers are paying these higher rates because their Bitcoin asset is performance
and these are producers. So, those are the two products coming from strike. And then from 21,
same update as always, we're working on the operating company, working towards an announcement,
which I'm very excited about. So with that, I'll do some Q&A. I got no Dylan. So I don't have a list of
questions you guys have asked throughout the show. I will pull up. Let's see. Let me pull up my face here.
Well, a haircut. Ladies, keep it together now. I'm just kidding. And let's see if I can get the
chat also pulled up. I wonder. Let's see. If I can display the chat next to my face, we can do a
little bit of live Q&A and call it an episode. Let's see you here.
Hmm.
Capture. Sorry, bear with me. First, I apologize. Not a professional.
Kids don't try this at home.
Oh, there we go. Okay. Now we've got oops, these, these. Now we've got my face.
There we go. My face next to the chat. Let's see. How mean are you guys being today?
Look, questions I can answer. All right. Let's go, chat. Bring it on.
Um, Jack, how does AI taking our jobs make the number go up?
Why? I hope AI doesn't take your job. It makes the number go up because they're going to have to
print a lot of money as a result. So when AI takes jobs and employment goes down, that means the
receipts that the government is collecting from all of us goes down. That also means we also don't
have money to invest in the stock market. So let's say income, employment receipts come down,
capital gains receipts come down. That makes it harder for the US to service its debt and you get
into this debt spiral, which will result in money printing or in utter and complete crisis austerity.
And in solvency. So that's why. All roads lead to them having to print a lot of money is the reality
of the situation. That's, that's how. Let's see, xxi update. Um, yeah, I see. You just spam an xxi in the
chat. xxi, xxi. What do you want me? What do you want me to say about xxi? I told you guys, uh, my update.
We're working on a bunch of exciting stuff. Nothing that I'm, uh, willing to announce today.
Sorry. Um, striking Italy will it be in 2026? Yes. We do expect Italy in 2026.
Uh, Jack, I'd really love to acquire more Bitcoin to your loan program, but 10.5 APR is too much.
Any update on lowering your guys APR rate or is that rate going to stay? Well, so here's the thing.
The problem is I'm limited to the people willing to lend Bitcoin, a lend dollars against Bitcoin, right?
So I, again, I connect with a bunch of people who are lending and then people who are borrowing.
And finding capital at low rates to lend against Bitcoin. Listen, I would give you guys three
percent if I could, but I can't because I'm not getting the dollars that cheap.
So I think that the market for borrowing against Bitcoin will always be a little bit higher than a
mortgage rate, for example, because it's private capital. It's not government subsidized,
Ponzi scheme money. Um, but I think that Bitcoiners can afford it because Bitcoin historically
has a cagor way higher than the interest rate and Bitcoiners are net producers by definition.
Right? They produce more than they consume, which means they have excess capital to save,
which they buy and save in Bitcoin. So you're talking about a cohort of people who are net producers.
And then you're talking about an asset that's exceeding the interest rate. So to compare,
the cagor of real estate is two to four percent. A mortgage at, you know, six plus percent,
the asset's not outperforming the interest rate. You know, Bitcoin over whatever duration you want to pick.
Its cagor is higher than 10 percent. So 10 and a half is not bad,
especially when you consider that the capital gains in the United States at cheapest is 20 percent.
So you've got long-term capital gains, 20 percent short-term capital gains, 30 percent.
So what would you rather do? Pay 20 to 30 percent in taxes and lose your Bitcoin upside
or borrow against it for 10 percent. That's why I think it's a no-brainer. That's why the
product has grown so much. Only for those that want to do it, you know, it grinds my gears
is people that want to tell everyone else how to live their life. You don't have to use the product
if you don't want to. And if you do use the product, you should do so responsibly.
When personal loans in the UK, we're working on it. It's just, it's a matter of licensing
and regulatory. It's tough. Obviously, I wish I can offer all of my products everywhere
all at once. Will the line of credit be available for companies? Yes, 100 percent.
Will absolutely be available for companies. Really excited about that. The line of credit to me is like the
most innovative revolutionary Bitcoin credit product ever because all anyone offers is like these
12 month loans because the capital that we're borrowing from has this 12 month duration to it.
Or else I would love to give you guys a five-year Bitcoin loan just there's no such thing.
So, anyways, the line of credit is huge because instead of having a borrow a lump sum of cash for
a year, you can just draw as you spend against your Bitcoin, which is amazing. Really excited about that.
Let's see.
Shout out, Queen. Always in the chat. Always supporting me. Jack, I just signed up.
Oh, shit. Jack, I just signed up. My new business account for strike business and I don't want
to have to use a regular Fiat bank account. Do you have recommendations for how I can, for example,
buy something at Amazon? Yes, so what I do for both our business and myself personally is I just
use credit cards because a credit card is like a free Fiat loan. So, I get to spend Fiat without
actually having to own Fiat. So, I go on Amazon, I buy whatever I need on Amazon, and then when I
go to pay my credit card bill, I pay that with strike and then you can use the line of credit.
So, let's say this. Let's say I have half a million dollars of Bitcoin on strike and I
spend five grand, ten grand a month on my rent, my credit card bill, my electricity bill,
you know, whatever, my car note, and that's all hooked up to strike. Well, it's pretty
straightforward, right? Like, I'm going to be like, when a bill comes in, strike creates a little
credit against the Bitcoin I have on the platform and pays the bill for me. And then it says,
be a notification, hey, your line of credit grew from $0 to $2,000 from $2,000 to $4,000. And then
when my paychecks come in, I can decide, do I want any of these this paychecks to pay down that line of
credit? Or do I want the line of credit to keep going? But then I don't have to borrow like $250,000
at once for one year's worth of spending and then Bitcoin bounces around and gets volatile.
And so, you're just using it as like a dynamic payment method. And so, I spend every day spending
I do on credit cards as my way to kind of interface with the existing Fiat world. So, it's worth
like a charm. It's incredible. And so, for that reason, I've actually been able to buy more
Bitcoin because my paychecks, you know, anything that I don't pay down, I just convert into Bitcoin.
So, my paychecks are like constantly DCAing. And then it's helped me not sell Bitcoin. So, instead of
yes, the whatever, 10% APRs high compared to a mortgage, but it's not high compared to capital
gains or Bitcoin's typical return. So, especially right now, I definitely don't want to be selling
Bitcoin now. On the biz line of credit, do you pay interest on your balance? If you clear it,
monthly or is the interest only applied to the carryover balance? We'll give out detail soon.
But the interest is accrued daily. And once you pay it off, it erases. So, it's a really,
really good product. Really good product. I'm really excited to get it out there. I think it's going to
change the way people are able to live on Bitcoin. What is three weeks next week?
Uh, I think we do have personal lending in Ireland. This guy asked that their personal loans in
Ireland. We should have personal loans in Ireland. So, check it out. Um, okay, I think, I think I'm done.
We've been going for an hour and a half. Uh, I have a stuffy nose. Okay. Oh, damn, a bunch more just
came in. Still hitting the links, Jack. I do not play as much golf as I probably would if I
wasn't so busy. That's okay. No worries. No worries.
I don't know who Robert Duval is. Am I supposed to know who that is?
Um, cool. I mean, a lot of these are just people keep spanning.
Let's see. Let's hear about XXI, what a joke. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all. Keep that same
energy. To other and I are excited about the future. It's all I'll say. Keep that energy. But keep
it coming. Keep it coming. But you know, my haters really drive me. You know, many people said
when we launched our Bitcoin lending product that I was a criminal scammer was going to blow up,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Just keep all the hate coming. It drives me. I really love it.
I have a, uh, I have a folder on my computer of screenshots of all the people. And these,
sometimes these are people that like will come up to me at conferences and be like, hey, man,
like, how's it going? And I could really use a favor. I'm like, aren't you the guy on Twitter that
just called me a criminal? So I keep a folder of it all. I really do. All right.
Uh, with that, I think I should end it, honestly. Um, I, yeah, I mean, this Q&A is nothing without
Dylan. With the chat coming in in real time is just impossible to deal. So, um, peace and love,
you guys, um, sorry if some of these topics were a little redundant. I mean, what's happening in
macros, what's happening in macros? It's not up to me. So, uh, it is what it is. It's, uh, Japan plus AI
seems to be forming a bit of a crisis and Bitcoin is basically giving us a forewarning of that.
So, let me know if you guys have questions in the YouTube comments, uh, if there are certain
parts of these topics that you want to dive deeper on or that you don't totally understand.
Um, get let me know what you thought about the, you know, it really grinds my gears, uh, segment.
You know, that was probably a part therapeutic for me to just be like, God, damn it, stop telling
me how to use my own Bitcoin. I want to loan against my Bitcoin, fucking sue me. Um, and part of it
also was just comedic value and maybe a little bit of education in there. So, if you guys liked it, let me
I'll do one to three grind my gears topics next and then we'll have Dylan back next week for
some Q&A. So, as always, leave feedback, appreciate you all. Hang in there. Turn on your DCAs,
lower your time preference, hunker down, these are the moments, legends are made, these are the
moments where returns are built. Uh, this is where to turn on your DCA, not financial advice, but at
least, that's, that's my opinion. And I'll catch you guys next week, hang in there. Uh, stay safe,
stay healthy, take care, peace and love.
