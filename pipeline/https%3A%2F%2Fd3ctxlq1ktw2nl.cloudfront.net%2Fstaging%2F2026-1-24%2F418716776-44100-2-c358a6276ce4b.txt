Welcome back to another episode of the Jack Mallors show I am your host Jack and you are
listening to yet another addition of mail, bag, Mondays, all signal, no noise, and no
ads. Every Monday, 6 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Central, 3 p.m. Pacific, let's get this show time
stamped. Ladies and gentlemen, I am talking to you live, at a bit coin price of $64,760
that puts bitcoins market cap at $1.29 trillion. Our all-time high remains at $126,160
were about 50% down from that all-time high, 48.7% to be exact. We made that all-time high
in October 6th, 2025, it's been $140 days. For those of you that keep track of the bitcoin
block height, time stamp your life in bitcoin block time. The last bitcoin block mine before I hit
record was bitcoin block height $938,033, the road to $1 million, not only in price but in blocks
baby, stay humble and stack sat, stay humble and mind blocks. All right ladies and gentlemen,
there's so much going on in the world, it's difficult for me to understand and to pick a topic.
What do the people want from the boy? What do you guys? What type of truth
needs to bear from my lips? And I decided on this, AI is breaking the system and what it means
for Bitcoin. I could have gone in a million different directions, gold continues to perform well,
it was gold was actually the US's second largest export of 2025. So I could have gone in that
direction, but we've talked enough about gold. We know who's buying it and we know why they're buying
it. We know why gold is performing and everything else isn't including Bitcoin. We know that.
What's becoming more of the story is what we on the show have been warning that Bitcoin has been
signaling. We've talked about Bitcoin as a smoke alarm, as a truth teller, as something that
leads markets. And we're like, man, Bitcoin started to look like shit's going to hit the fan.
Bitcoin has started to look like there's a credit crisis looming. And all of a sudden, guys,
it's happening. Now, I'm known to be emotional. I love a good time. I love cursing and screaming.
So I'm not telling you to hit your bunker and buy up toilet paper like we're in COVID,
but we might not be far off. Let's get into it. So the title of the show, AI is breaking the
system and what it means for Bitcoin. Chapter one, the white collar wipe out, AI is not coming
for jobs. It's already here taking your jobs. So in large part, this was inspired by a real-life
conversation I was having. So to not dox people in my personal life, I was having a conversation
with someone in my life and they're in a count it. Okay. And they're not necessarily in Bitcoin.
I just know them for other reasons. And we're at a lunch and we're talking to AI comes up
and I'm like, man, AI, I use AI all the time. It's hard for me to imagine a life before AI.
Like, this show, for example, I'm using AI. Like, I got my whole setup. I've already talked to you
guys about it. I've got my developer setup. I'm honestly in the middle of vibe coding all sorts
like a to-do list and ideas app. Like, it's easier for me to talk to an intelligent agent to
perform how I need to perform. And I go, how are you guys using AI in accounting? And it goes,
using AI. I don't use AI. My jaw hit the floor. I said, what? Aren't you an accountant? You don't
use AI? You said, yeah, we're very counter-culture. We're very against AI. We're like screwing
AI. You know what I mean? We're not going to use it out of principle. And I'm sitting here.
And this is just a normal dude. You know what I mean? He's not a Bitcoin or he's not probably like
all tuned into how anthropic tweets about their new models or crashing stuff. He doesn't have
a fucking clue. This dude, he does accounting and then he's smoking meats and he drinks
Guinness and he plays golf. And I sat there and was like, oh my god. Like, nobody has any idea.
Nobody has any idea. That was my literal read. That's why I was like, I have to talk about this
on the show. Nobody has any idea. The VIX, the volatility, the stock market remains low, the bond
market volatility, the move index remains low, credit spreads remain wide. I mean, markets are
whole hum. As if everything's fine, nothing is wrong. We're casually reshoring, which we have,
like nobody has any idea. No stock market all time high. So the United States, one of the
old mental and hockey U.S. Hey, you, nobody has any idea. So let's take a look, guys. First of all,
corporate America is panicking right now. If you take even a second to do a little bit of research,
you'll realize shit is already hitting the fan. Okay. This is AI disruption mentions in earnings calls.
Q4 earnings calls hit a smashing record, nearly doubling prior mentions. Look at the growth of
AI disruption mentions during earnings calls over the last four years. It went from barely
a mention to a mention on every single call. I need you guys to conceptually understand the rate
in pace of that level of change. It went from, wait, AI is an actual thing. To, if you have an earnings
call in AI is not mentioned, there's a problem. Guys, that's insane. Now, over the weekend,
I don't know how to pronounce this research firm. Citrini, Citrini, let's just go with
Citrini. This research firm, Citrini, posted a sub-stack article. And it's actually really good
I recommend reading it. It's long, though. It's long. You can see my little AI thing. This browser
extension I have that reads everything to me. It was about a 45 minute read, but I had my morning
and espresso read to me while I was playing some chess. It was a good read. The article is titled
the 2028 global intelligence crisis. And it's as if we're in June, 2028 and they're writing
their traditional macro monthly newsletter, but unemployment at 10%, the stock market has gotten
hammered and it's a two year lookback as to where we are today as if we're in the year 2028 of what
happened. That this giant deflationary wave of technology hit us in the face, crash the stock market,
rendered everyone unemployed and just destroyed the world as we know it. And as I've said before,
you're a victim if you want to be, right? And obviously rendered a beautiful world for humans as
creators and efficiency and deflationary tendencies making everything more accessible and achievable.
But ruined this debt-ridden system that we had built. Okay, cool article, sub-sac article,
who gives a fuck? Well, Monday morning, the stock market's getting obliterated in what hits
the Bloomberg terminal is software, payment shares, sync after citrine, satrini post on AI risks.
Wall Street is citing the sub-stack post as why the stock market is crashing. And I screenshot
it, Arthur's tweet here, which reads the AI destruction common knowledge game is revving up
because it's one thing for me to be talking about this. It's one thing for Bitcoin to be warning
us about this. Then to see people posting about it on sub-stack and you're getting these kind of like
semi-nonfiction looks into the future of what a world looks like if AI actually works and it's
actually working, right? And then it's a whole other thing for Wall Street to now be reading all of
our sub-stacks, be watching all of our podcasts and being holy shit, sell all the stocks,
deflation is meeting a debt-ridden system. And let me, let me make a quick point here.
Because sometimes I see people say things like, well, the AI agents aren't that good. Have you,
have you tried to tell it to make ingredients for meatloaf? It's not that good. I can make better meatloaf.
That's not the point. The point is it will eventually get that good. That's the point.
That's not how markets work. You guys need to understand this point really quickly. Pay attention.
If you're, if you're hitting a PR on the bench, if you're driving and you're switching lanes,
pay attention. This is how markets work. They price in the future.
If it will happen, you price it in now. It's not about whether Claude can make a better meatloaf
ingredients less than you today. It will eventually. That's the point. It will be a better accountant.
It will do better analysis on your blood work. It will write better legal documents.
It will write better software. The point is it will. In any doubt that it won't,
and it can't, is gone. And the way markets work is they start pressing that reality in today.
They're forward looking. You understand? And so when everyone, when anyone ever said,
well, these things aren't that good. That's not the point. Now, if we're talking about how they
can impact your life today, yeah, I don't use AI for everything yet. I use AI for some things.
I use AI to help me make this show. It's really good at making slide decks. It's not really good at
other things. That's a separate conversation. How is it going to impact markets? Will it cause
enough disruption in the job market to cause a cascading debt spiral in this $40 trillion debt
written Fiat system? That's the question you need to ask yourself. Why is Bitcoin acting like
the world is on fire? Why is AI disrupting in displacing jobs on every single earnings call?
Why is a sub-stack article being referenced as the reason there's red dots everywhere
all over everyone's Bloomberg terminal? That's the thing you need to ask yourself. When you're
at happy hour and some dudes are pro these models aren't even that impressive. That's not how
markets work. So one sub-stack post, a single research post, look at the damage done, visa,
master card, door dash, service now, blackstone, murdered, murdered in the sub-stack post. Again,
you guys should read it. It not only talks about AI, it talks about stable coins. Again, it's in the
year 28. It's like, I go and I buy it. I forget what it said exactly. I go buy a bacon egg and cheese
and I use stable coins. And there's no interchange for visa to take anymore. Anyone can be on
the issuing side. Anyone can be on the acquiring side. Now, I don't know why stable coins are
that innovative. We'll get to that in a second during the grind my years. But I agree with the
notion that open networks will beat these closed predatory monopolistic networks. And so this
futuristic post where extreme deflation, technology is so good at bringing the cost of everything
down, bringing efficiencies into our life. And all of these legacy models are finally getting
disrupted by pure innovation for everybody. Look at the damage done. I mean, visa down 4.5%
master card down 6.5% American Express down almost 8% capital 1 down over 8% from a sub-stack post.
You cannot make this shit up. We live in the craziest timeline. Guys, like, this is crazy.
This is real life. I woke up this morning and I had my espresso.
And I'm like, wait, what? Some dude wrote a sub-stack post and companies are losing tens of
billions of dollars of equity capital. What did he say? And I click into the thing. I can't
you not. I click into the thing. And he's like, the year is 2028. I just scanned a QR code with my
stable coin fintech wallet for my new AI agent subscription. I no longer need a nurse, an accountant,
or a lawyer, or an engineer. I simply am an artistic expression of my interest. I'm like,
this guy crashed the stock market? Oh, we live in the best timeline. So just more details.
The repricing is happening as we speak. Like, literally as I'm talking, shit is selling off. The
S&P is down 2% from its highs, software, which we know has been relatively correlated to Bitcoin recently,
is down anywhere from 30 to 65%. So the tweet on the left reads, this is absolutely insane.
On February 20th, which is three days ago, at one PM Eastern,
clawed an ounce, clawed code security. It's an automated AI tool that scans a software code
based for vulnerabilities. As of one PM Eastern today, two trading days later of that announcement,
crowd strike, the stock, is down $20 billion in market cap. Just a complete nuke.
Then the tweet from Charlie, percentage below all time highs. I'm not talking about Bitcoin.
I'm not talking about your cousins, boyfriends, nephews, favorite shit coin. I'm talking about
equities. I'm talking about the S&P, percent below all time high. S&P 500, down 2%,
Microsoft, Microsoft, down 30%, synopsis, 36% Palo Alto networks, 36% crowd strike, 38%
Palantir, 38% Apple oven, 50% sales force, 52% into it, 57% service now, 59%
Oracle, 60, 60%, percent, Adobe, 65%.
See, the problem is, people say, my imitation game is just too strong. It's so strong. It
makes me laugh at myself. The problem is, people, uh, that Bitcoin was the new goal. That
they'll pick or it's going to be better gold. Yeah, but it's a becoming asset. Hey, moron. An asset
can't go from leaking on an email list to being the new gold. Do you know how long it took
gold to be gold tens of thousands of years? Like Bitcoin is the size of Tesla. It's going to take
a second. How about you submit a poll request to the fucking open source repository and stop
complaining and help the future of humanity and your kids, kids? Anyway, uh, that Bitcoin was the new
gold. Well, here's the problem. Bitcoin's correlation of gold is 0.09. In other words, it's not correlated
at all. In other other words, for people at home that need help in turning their brain on,
Bitcoin and gold don't move at the same time. They're fundamentally different assets in that
way for now for now. All of us that believe Bitcoin will become the one money. We're buying the
future. That the the the value upside we're getting is because the world doesn't realize what we
realize yet. So people need to fundamentally understand that. Now for everything that isn't gold
that isn't the legacy central bank sovereign safe haven. Again, guys, Bitcoin cannot be a
central bank sovereign safe haven because it's not big enough yet. It's the size of China's annual
trade surplus. It's literally like the skeletal frame of Bitcoin. It's like asking a teenager to
bench press 500 pounds. It's going to kill himself, put take in the bar off the rack. Okay. Now for
everything else, Bitcoin is acting like a fortune teller. It's acting like it knows the future.
So Bitcoin falls off a cliff and everyone's like, oh my god, everything you said is wrong,
Bitcoin's broken. Oh my god, hold my hand, cradle me like a baby. But then you just let the
future play out as Bitcoin is warning us of something and listen to this. Microsoft down 30%
Microsoft's barely outperforming Bitcoin in a bear market oracles down 60% oracle is performing
worse than shit coins than Ethereum. Isn't Larry Ellison like one of the richest guys in the
world? So you're even starting, you know, here's where it gets like, okay, I'm not exaggerating.
You're even starting to see comments from the Fed. Fed governor Waller said weak labor market is
likely to continue going forward. CEO say significant job cuts are coming from AI.
If you're getting forward signs from the Fed, that is signal to sell everything and take cover.
This is serious. The federal reserve is saying weak labor market is going to continue.
All your friends and family, they're all going to get fired because the CEOs are telling us
that AI is just getting started. Wait, who said that? Your drunk uncle? No, the Fed.
The Fed said that. Not the Jack Mallorys show. The Jack Mallorys show said that two months ago.
The Fed said that. So if you take a look at the actual data, this is not a normal recession or
whatever. I guess technically it's not a recession, although it absolutely should be.
Take a look at the white collar joblessness that's happening right now.
So this is from a Bloomberg article, white collar joblessness rose in 2025.
And if you see how much it arrives, office and administrative support getting hammered,
management, business and financial getting hammered, sales and related getting hammered,
professional and related getting hammered, what's not getting hammered, what actually
is growing in jobs, installation, maintenance and repair, transportation and material moving,
construction and extraction, production, farming, fishing and forestry.
Now this guys, again, this is the beginning of this new monetary order,
where we're no longer going to be the world reserve currency as we know it.
I've told you, do I expect a politician to admit that out loud? No, I do not. It's going to take
the world a lot of time to understand what you and I understand. But what's going to happen?
The US has to resure blue collar work, producing real things. It has to bring back a manufacturing
base infrastructure, core materials, a defense, a ability to manufacture and produce its own
defense. That means blue collar is coming back and white collar is getting disrupted.
Since just a taste of the trend I've been screaming about, farming, fishing, up,
office administrative management, business, financial sales, down. And here's the thing,
and I've talked about the book The End Times. When you live in a hyper financialized economy
driven by fiat and dollar and printing pieces of paper that you've monetized as the
populist's time, energy, effort and labor, what happens is in order for people to live a life
that they deem worth living, meaning they want to get married, they want to have kids,
they want to have a house, they want to go on vacation, they want to own a car,
they want to be able to acquire energy, meaning the car needs to drive, the plane needs to fly,
the TV needs to turn on, they have an energy consuming lifestyle. Everyone feels like they need
to go to university to do that. They need to go to university, get in debt, and have a high
flying tech job, a high flying wall street job, a high flying venture capital job.
Everyone was pushed to the coast, New York, San Francisco, and pushed to white collar work.
So you have to understand the amount of income focused in these office administrative management
business, financial sales, professional services, finance, the amount of income in tax receipts,
that AI is going after, is immense, it's what underpins this massive economy that's backed
by $40 trillion in debt. So on that note, that was my segue into the educated class, is what I
call them, I don't know, young kids are just, I mean, I'm terrified for the revolutionaries that we're
creating today. You know, I, man, you know, here's some, let me get real first second.
When I, when I build these businesses, strike 21, you know, our core target customer is a big
business or an institution or a high net worth individual, because it's very difficult to monetize
people in financial services that don't yet have wealth, right? Like, where do I make the most revenue
or the most money? Well, when someone takes out a hundred million dollar loan or buys ten
million dollars worth of Bitcoin for their business. You know, obviously, that's our commission
is higher than the 21 year old that buys five dollars worth of Bitcoin because they shoveled
snow for their neighbor, right? However, people have seen me try and reach the youth and I make
a concerted effort to make sure that I don't alienate my generation and those below me.
Where the hoodie be real, talk normal, don't turn into a suit, don't appease these chunks on Wall Street
and, you know, one of the many reasons I do that is because you have to understand the crisis that's
happening to the youth. You have to. You cannot say, oh, back in my day, I used to have to walk to
school, no, these kids can call an Uber. You don't understand what they're going through. And so,
I pray even if we get a few kids listening to this show and I know I curse and some of the topics
are hard to understand, but this is how revolutions are born and this is where people pick up weapons
and hurt themselves or hurt other people. This is where it's scary. So these tweets, 42% of recent
college graduates are under employed, the highest level since COVID. Unemployed Americans with
four-year college degrees hit a record in January at 36.6% of those aged 25 and older.
New graduates now account for just 7% of new hires at Big Tech down from 25% only two years ago
and over 50% before COVID. Before COVID, if you got a college degree, you were basically employed.
After COVID, 25%, you better have gotten good grades, you better have taken it easy on the
booths and the partying. Now, college degree means nothing. So how's this for a sick joke?
Kids are born today and encouraged to get into as much debt as possible just to have a chance
at what they see in the movies, just to have a chance to experience what their parents did,
just to have a chance to feel happy enough and optimistic enough about their future.
Just to have a chance to own a home, not to actually own a home, a chance to drive a car,
a chance to fall in love and have kids. Go up to their eyeballs and debt.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt. And there's no job for them.
That's a sick joke. Push kids into mountains of debt. These are children.
Epstein seems to be the hot topic and we talk about what's the age of consent?
What are you abusing children?
Children can't consent to sexual activity until they're adults, but you have these mobsters
in these thugs on Wall Street and in the government pushing them into eyeball levels of indebtedness
before they're adults. You got $16, 17-year-old kids signing up for $100,000 plus dollars of debt.
That's abuse!
So I'm in my early 20s. I'm up to my eyeballs and debt. I have no way to pay it back. No one's
willing to give me a job. And you wonder why these kids don't like Elon Musk. They vote for
Mombani. They want to violate property rights. They're picking up weapons. They're organizing
and discord chats. Now the way out is to build a better future. We did not have a choice
to what we inherited, but it is our choice to what we grow into and what we build and what our
kids inherit. That's up to us. But let me tell you firsthand the most painful thing is when you
have adults say, well I used to have to walk to school. Shut the fuck up!
You also got to buy a $15,000 house. Going to a movie was a quarter. Get an education didn't
require a debt that takes a life to pay off. And you weren't competing against digital intelligence
to just make rent. How about that? How about that? Hey, I'll walk to school and you compete
against digital intelligence. Shout out to all the youth out there. We're going to build our way
out of this. Do not pick up a weapon. Do not take on any more debt. We're going to stay humble. We're
going to stack sats and we're going to make it to the other side. So from Bloomberg,
unprecedented jobless boom, Tesla limits of U.S. economic expansion. So again, guys, my point
is this stuff is happening. So if you look on the left, this graphic is from the Bloomberg article,
U.S. Real GDP traditionally is correlated to payroll. When GDP is booming, supposedly the economy
is booming, the economy is booming. Everyone's got a job. Everyone's making money. Everyone can afford
whatever it is for you. The first class flight seats on your vacation, supersize your meal.
Whatever. I don't know what that is for you. You can afford it. The economy's humming.
But what you're looking at on the left is U.S. GDP is ticking up again because of AI, but payroll
is heading towards recessionary levels. Payrolls heading down. GDP's heading up. That's the
K shape of economy visualized. There's a lot of wealth being created, but it's highly concentrated
and everyone young unemployed. Everyone white collar and they're using this term under employed
under employed means I have a business degree from Kellogg at Northwestern and I'm making your
Chipotle burrito. That's what they mean by under employed. Now it's a difference between
under employed unemployed. I counted effectively the same is that those people never
going to own a home. They're going to be depressed. They're going to revolutionize. It's just bad.
It's dangerous. It's sad. This is not something I'm speculating on anymore. This is not something
I'm predicting anymore. This is happening. From the Wall Street Journal on the right,
healthcare work propels U.S. to strongest job growth in more than a year. And the article
goes through how, so I'll read the subhead or subheader, jobs surge 130,000 in January, while unemployment
fell to 4.3%. But the article goes on to just tell it's all healthcare. It's all healthcare.
So again, you've got a business degree. You want to be an accountant. You want to be a lawyer.
You want to be in finance. Not only is there no one hiring you. If you are one of those,
you're getting fired. So what can you do? Well, for one, you can punch shit coins. You can
punt prediction markets. You can gamble on sports. So again, why is hyper speculation so popular?
Because during currency debasement, the fall of an empire, when deflationary technology meets
a debt written society, everyone's a speculator, whether you know it or not.
Someone that has never heard of me and the show in Bitcoin and financial markets,
they're also a speculator. You're getting compensated in a currency that cannot support your
future. Things that you need to acquire in your future are getting more expensive than you are earning.
There are less opportunities for you in the economy and everything around you is getting
more expensive. That turns you into a gambler, whether you know it or not. Because if you want
an aboning a home, well, shit, I better predict the final four correctly. I better put
options on Nvidia's earnings. I better, well, it was too late. I, I didn't buy Bitcoin in 2010.
Better, a better hope. Dogecoin goes up. That's what happens. So the last thing I wanted to know
before we move on is just a reminder that this is also a war. So not to make the AI companies, the
bad guys here. In fact, I think that it's unbelievable what they're achieving. Mind you, technology
is deflationary. And technology is arguably the greatest trait us humans have. We're able to
collaborate. We're future oriented and we build tools. That's what Steve Jobs said, right? Like the
biggest difference between us and other primates is we're tool builders. Steve Jobs had that
amazing quote where he said, if you compare us to other primates where us running versus Jaguar,
us running versus, I don't know, whatever the fastest animals were not the fastest by far. There's
way more efficient faster species than humans. But you know what no one can compete with us in an
airplane or us in a car. It's not even a competition. We dust everybody. And what's the insight
there? The insight is humans are tool builders. Don't measure us in plain form. Measure us by what
we build. And what we're building in AI is deflationary is when kids, when you're in school,
they talk about deflation like it's a bad thing because it does crash the economy. But what we'll
talk about in this episode is why that's not the technology's fault. That's the economy's fault.
Deflation makes everything easier, more efficient, more achievable, more accessible.
When things are deflationary, your money goes further. Think about it. If AI ends up changing
all of our lives, you don't need to pay an accountant anymore. You don't need to pay software
developers anymore. You don't need to pay lawyers anymore. You don't need to pay money managers anymore.
Think about what Bitcoin and AI can do for you. You are your own bank. You are your own money
manager. You are your own software engineer. You are your own accountant. You are your own lawyer.
You are empowered and limited. You are only limited to your own ambition and your own ideas.
That's incredibly empowering. It brings the cost of everything down tremendously. The only
thing you really need to make sure you can pay for is the roof over your head and the food that
goes in your belly. That's it. That's incredible. That's incredible. Now, bringing it back to
this slide, it's also national security. So, anthropic tweeted today, we've identified industrial
scale distillation attacks on our models deep seek, excuse me, on our models buy deep seek,
moonshot AI, and mini-max. These labs created over 24,000 fraudulent accounts and generated
over 16 million exchanges with Claude, extracting its capabilities to train and improve their own
models. What's kind of funny, I will say, China seems to be trying to extract intelligence out
of the U.S. via these attacks and open source it. It is interesting. I got to admit, the way
that the American media and the American corporations are going to phrase it is we're being attacked,
China's coming after us, but China's trying to do is say, all software should be open source.
We're up at deep seek for example. We're open sourcing all of our AI. The world should be about
real stuff. Obviously, they're talking their own book. They've got all the critical minerals,
they've got all the rare earths, they've got all the production and manufacturing capabilities,
they've got all the defense capabilities. They're talking their own book, but I do believe in
open source software. This whole U.S. of Earth's China Cold War and AI War, there's a lot of
catch-22s. Do I like that China is aggressively trying to, basically, latch on to how fast U.S.
development is enhancing and just basically cheat off our homework? No, I would much rather the
internet and the West and distributed networks defeat the CCP, but I am a fan of open source software.
I would really appreciate it if open AI and anthropic, if they all open source their models.
If Elon open source, this Twitter or X algorithm. But anyway, the point is just a reminder that
this is of national security. So the other thing to keep in mind is losing the AI race is not an option.
It's going to be important. I'll reference it back later, but what we can't have happen as a
country is say, holy shit, this is all going way too fast, over regulate the AI industry to where
no one can build anything and then China takes over the AI race. That's not an option. It's
declared not an option. This has been declared a national security threat. This is a national security
interest. So my point is, this is a one-way train. It's only getting faster and these things are
already happening. So what seemed to be like a credit crisis brewing and as Bitcoin seemed to be
hinting that out, yeah, this seems to be the case. So entering chapter two, deflation meets
debt. Why is successful AI is bad for markets? So here's the logic, and I just want to break it down
for those who don't totally understand. AI is a productivity shock. That's what all technology is,
like the car made us highly productive relative to horses. The airplane made us even more productive.
Technology are traditionally productive tools. They provide efficiencies in the marketplace
that previously were not there. And by the way, that's how the free market and technology works.
You don't build something that isn't better than what already exists because if you do, you'll fail.
So this form of Darwinism is the only things that you're incentivized to build and the only things
that succeed are things that provide more value than the things that exist today. And so we have this
very efficient system where all technology trends towards being productive because you're highly
incentivized to build something that will actually work that's actually more valuable than what
people have today. And by the way, it has to be a lot more valuable than what people have today
because the switching cost within itself is decently expensive. So you don't see technology that's
marginally better. You see technology that gets way better. And humans just kick butt at this.
I don't see lions building software and shit. We, I mean, we're the best at building tools.
So AI is the latest productivity shock coming from us humans, the godfather of all tool building.
Okay, what that causes is this term I've been using called deflation. Now I put in this slide
what it's doing is it makes the dollar more valuable. But I don't know if that's going to land with
you guys because I shit on the dollar so much and I can already see my comments. I thought you said the dollar
was a good. I thought you said the dollar was like, you guys just fucking donkeys in my comments all day.
So what I mean by it makes the dollar more valuable is what I said earlier if the marginal cost of
intelligence of accounting, of financial services, of legal work, if of the marginal cost of that
trends to zero or as close to zero as possible, that means that your capital goes further.
Right, you can raise a family on low income now because you don't need all of these things anymore.
It brings the cost of everything around you down. Now the reason that is a problem. This is a
really important point. You have to understand why deflation is bad in the fiat game that we've
created. This debt written financial system. It's because it collapses the debt that they've built.
Why? Let me explain. If we owe $40 trillion, if the dollar continues to weaken and be worth less,
it's easier to pay back $40 trillion. Think about it this way, guys. Let's say we go through so much inflation
and we go through so much dollar debasement that it costs $40 trillion to get into a movie in five
years, 10 years, 20 years. Well then it's really trivial to pay back $40 trillion that we owe because
it's only one movie's worth of time, energy, effort, and labor, right? The dollar's gotten so
weak that the debt denominated in dollars is so easy to pay off. Now, if humans are so productive
in their building things like AI which delivers such a productivity shock that's so deflationary,
that actually has the opposite effect. It has the opposite effect. It means that people being
accountants and people being lawyers and people doing all this white collar work and the
US government collecting tax receipts from that isn't going to come close to paying off the $40 trillion.
Because we're all going to be vibe coding our apps, living off, whatever. There's going to be people
living off low-income, but they're just into history. They're just into making music. They're just
into whatever artist, they're just into what they want, but you don't need that much money. You don't
need to produce that much work and get that much taxed and speculate that much in the stock market
and it has the opposite effect where it gets increasingly more difficult to pay down the debt.
And that's when you see if unemployment gets to 10%, then the US tax receipts come way down,
then the deficit relative to the tax receipts and you start to see a death spiral.
And so when I say a deflationary force is meeting an indebted system in their colliding,
meaning they one of them has to win. If we go into true deflation and AI renders everyone
unemployed and is like the biggest productivity shock we've seen in modern history,
then we're entering a debt spiral, a level of austerity that is magnitudes greater than the
great depression. And so what happens is a credit crisis. So when I say a credit crisis is
looming, shits hitting the fan, the last episode I'm bringing up delinquencies. Now I'm talking
about white collar joblessness. I'm talking about the level of unemployment in the youth.
Credit crisis, meaning how much of our economy is predicated on mortgages, on car notes,
on credit cards. If retail can't afford their payments, they're rendered delinquate. And what
happens? Bank stocks are going to crater. Bank stocks are going to crater because the market will
realize they have all these outstanding loans and they're not going to get paid back. When
bank stock craters, stock markets crater, stock markets crater, the 401k's are in the in the
shitter. 401k's are in the shitter, US government tax receipts are in the shitter, tax receipts are
in the shitter, then the bond market gets volatile, the bond market gets volatile, the US defaults.
It's a giant game of charades, a giant Ponzi scheme that's predicated on more debt, more money
printing. And so the whole solution to this game is they have to print an immense amount of money,
like an ungodly amount. I'm talking about magnitudes bigger than COVID. And this isn't me,
I'm not biously wishing for this. I'm just doing the math. Like there is a certain amount of
liquidity that's going to have to combat these deflationary forces and provide the liquidity
necessary to persist onwards. Another way to think about it is theoretically because humans are constantly
producing technology that's more efficient, providing value and providing productivity gains.
Everything around you should to be getting cheaper. And evidence of this is Bitcoin.
When I got into Bitcoin, one house was like 100,000 Bitcoin's. Now the average house is like
five Bitcoin. Life has gotten immensely cheaper for me in Bitcoin terms because humans have
been more productive. If your money is fixed and supply, you get all the productivity that humans
are constantly innovating. I'm soaking up all the gains from AI, soaking up all the gains
from the internet. I'm soaking up all the gains from whatever research MIT labs are doing,
whatever. I'm soaking up all the gains because my money supply is fixed. If your money supply is
causing you inflation, where things around you are getting more expensive, that means that
central banks and governments are printing more money than humans are innovating. Just sit on that
for a second. Because the default state is things get cheaper because we are producing more
innovative revolutionary tech. Just think about that for a second. So the fact that we have been
living through inflation means they're printing so much money that even the most revolutionary
technologies aren't bringing the costs down of goods and services. And so in order for them to
maintain the debt system that they've built up and not have an utter and complete credit crisis,
debt spiral, they have to print enough money to outlast this AI deflation and you've got all sorts
of problems like what's happening in Japan, which we're not even going to get into in this episode.
So here, this asset's a little small. Let me blow this up. Hold on. There we go.
So this is from the global liquidity index. I just subscribed to this guy's name's Michael Howell.
Really good stuff. I just subscribed to his stuff. I just paid for his research stuff. Really good.
And so he has this metric. Instead of debt to GDP, he does debt to liquidity, which is arguably
better. And he shows this chart debt to liquidity. And when it's high, you get these crises.
Right? So you've got the Y2K crisis, the Lehman 2008 crisis, the Eurozone banking crisis. And when
it's down, you get these bubbles. So you've got the US housing bubble, you've got the everything
bubble, which is COVID. And you see debt to liquidity trending up. It's trending towards crisis mode.
Okay? And so this is plumbing data. So what's the debt to liquidity? Yes, there's a lot of money
printing and there's some liquidity. Like the Fed paused QT. It's restarted some kind of form of QE.
But the question is, is it enough printing to prevent a credit crisis? And this is just looking at
the debt to liquidity. This is not taking into account the deflationary force that is AI. Okay?
And so when I zoom back out, the cracks are already starting to show. So last week, Blue Owl
came out and they halted with draws. So Blue Owl limits investor withdrawals during private
credit concerns. Blue Owl. Okay. And their stock got the got crushed. Blue Owl capital
ink shares tumble after a decision to restrict withdrawals from one of its private credit funds
raised fresh concern over the risks bubbling under the surface of the 1.8 trillion dollar market.
Again, so people want to say, is it Bitcoin the new gold? Is it Bitcoin the new gold?
This fucking market is bigger than Bitcoin. Bitcoin still small. Give it a rest. Okay?
Shares of the alternative asset manager fell about 10% on Thursday to their lowest level
in two and a half years. Now Blue Owl came out and gave a statement and said, whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Like we're we're solvent. We're fine. And then Blue Bird comes out with another article
that says Blue Owl sold their loans to pensions and their own insurance asset manager.
So it's like, oh, who bailed out Blue Owl? And then you read the article and you realize they
bailed themselves out by selling themselves these loans. How is this not 2008 all over again?
I mean, you got to be shitting me. No wonder Bitcoin's been in the shitter. Bitcoin doesn't
know any better than to be the most sensitive thing to fiat liquidity, the most sensitive thing
to fiat credit. It's all it knows how to do, just be honest. And so, you know, I titled this
slide you for a meat reality since COVID, the performance of stocks and the sentiment of consumers
has totally divorced. We're totally living in K-shaped. Look at this. This is this is a K.
Everyone's depressed. Everyone's violent. Everyone's protesting. Everyone's revolutionizing.
Meanwhile, our president is like, whoa, if you do, if you look at the stock market this way,
no, fuck, fuck the president. Pam Bondi, the woman that grinds my gears is like, hey,
how about we arrest these people, these demons that were raping and killing our children?
She's like, well, look at the dough. You've got these idiots, these morons,
telling me to check the price of the dow. Meanwhile, our entire country is on anti-depressants in
OZEMPIC. Sickening. So, the other thing that's critically important that I need to tell you guys,
because here's the thing. What people will do is they'll say, well, let's look at 2008,
if we're entering a 2008 level crisis, global financial crisis. Well, the markets took many years
to rebound. It took them a long time to print the money. It ended up being a decade of, well,
not an actual decade, but relatively of QE and of money printing. And so, is that what we're
heading into Jack? No, at least, listen, pause. I don't know the future. I hate that I have to tell
you guys that. There's like, hey, dude, you said that. You said, dude, I don't know the future, bro.
I hate that I have to admit that to you. Like, what human knows the future? What human thinks
and other human knows the future? Okay, I don't know what's going to happen. All I can do is
record these shows and give my best effort and have a good time with you guys. So, I don't know what's
going to happen, but what's different from 2008? This is critically important. The IMF came out
with a paper recently, last week, and they said, bonds have been less effective equity hedges since
the pandemic, since COVID. And they go into explain that basically, when stocks sell off,
now bonds sell off. Bonds traditionally are safe haven. We've talked about this. What's happening
in Japan? Right? Traditionally, the currency was strengthened. The bond market was strengthened.
Their safe haven, safety and bonds. Bonds are no longer safe haven because the debt is too
tall as too large. The U.S. wasn't nearly as indebted 20 years ago as it is today.
Nearly not even close. It has too much debt to even sustain that much pain.
So, this on the right from this guy, Eric, are finding suggest that the Cayman Island hedge funds
are increasingly the marginal foreign buyers of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds. They absorbed
37% of net issuance of notes and bonds. Nearly the same amount is all other foreign investors
combined. I've talked about this before. The hedge funds in the Cayman Islands, they're performing
the carry trade. They're performing an immense amount of leverage to just arbitrage. They're
not actually lending to the United States. We know China isn't lending to the United States at
the margins anymore. They're buying gold. We know India is also increasing their gold position.
So, my point is, when equity sell off, bond sell off, both because it's structurally,
these hedge funds have to unwind their positions because they're collateralized,
look by the existing financial system. And then also, there's too much debt.
So, the point that I'm making here is that they're going to have to print an immense amount of
money immediately. That's why when you see people say like the big print is coming, the big
print is coming. The United States doesn't have the tolerance and the appetite to allow for years
of financial crisis because it would not be able to finance itself. It cannot afford an unruly
bond market even for a week. Remember what happened during Liberation Day? It took like four days
before Trump reversed everything he made and they printed the money. Like they literally it is
like a giant deck of cards that the single bit gust of wind of opening the door will blow it all
down. And so, even the little it's a bit, it's not even, it's the fact that here's here's the
thing to say. Everybody knows that everybody knows that AI is coming and that's the only bit of gust
of wind that can blow this thing to the ground. It doesn't actually matter how good cloud is at this
or what Sam Altman said about that. The point is, is this deflationary and is it working?
If that's true, the gust of deflationary wind will blow this whole thing down and it's already happening.
So, there's no such thing as, now, I don't want to take away the fact that this Bitcoin market
has been painful and I know that a lot of you out there have been facing a lot of pain and I
don't want to take that away from you. This is where champions are made. This is where you earn your
stripes. This is where you put some hair on that chest. This is it. This is where you earn the returns
when people are Thanksgiving say, oh, you just got lucky. No, I didn't. I was there during the AI
credit panic and I buckled down and I stacked some sets. So, I know a lot of you are in pain and
I encourage you to weather the storm. But what I'm telling you is this is not 2008. They're going to
have to print in print fast. So, the question is, when is it going to sufficiently break? Now,
I look at some data and I'm like, well, things are already breaking. Now, not to the degree where
it's panic, but check this tweet. So, first, wild market. We haven't seen anything like this
since the dot com bubble burst. Over the last eight sessions, 115 stocks in the S&P 500 have
declined 7% or more in a single day. The average drawdown when that happens is 34%. Right now,
we are only one and a half percent below the all-time high. So, again, based on everything I'm talking
about, the stock market is due for a 20, 25, 30, 35% correction. Now, the question is,
are authorities going to let that happen? At what point do they start printing the money,
which is when Bitcoin goes on its absolute tear? To remind you guys, Bitcoin got hit the hardest,
fell the fastest and fell first with COVID. It went from 8,000 to 4,000 in a day. But then,
it was the best performer. It went from 3,000 to 70,000 in a year. So, it gets hit the hardest,
it gets hit first, it performs the best. It's part of being a champion, it's part of being the
man in the arena, it's part of being a pioneer, it's part of fighting for the world we want to
live in, a Bitcoin world. Okay. Now, this tweet, going back to 1995, the US has never performed
worse compared to international stocks year to date. So, again, capital's rotating out of the
United States of America. The stock market is getting hammered. People are selling the US. People
are fearing credit crisis. AI is disrupting. It is leaving white college jobless. It is leaving the
youth unemployed with college degrees. This is actually happening. This was today. I took the
screenshot at market close. This is not crypto.com. This is Google, Meta, Microsoft,
Berkshire, Hathaway, JP Morgan, Tesla, JP Morgan down over 4% today. Microsoft, 3.5%
Amazon, 2.5% getting smoked, getting smoked. This is what Bitcoin was warning us about. Why
did Bitcoin sell off last night? Guys, don't fight. Don't fight it. Don't try and argue with it.
It's never wrong. It's just, it's information. It's a utility. It's telling you something that
nothing else can. Whenever it's moving, it's speaking. Just listen to it. So, chapter 3,
last chapter, the canary in the coal mine. Bitcoin tells you what's coming. So, I tweeted this last
week. Bitcoin is the orange line. Has been labeled week since it's emerged from the NASDAQ,
which is the white line. What if it's the smoke alarm? The only truly free market we have left.
If an AI driven credit shock is coming, would Bitcoin detect it first? Maybe it's telling
us what's centrally planned markets can't. So, this was my tweet paraphrasing the last hour of
me yabbing and running my mouth. Bitcoin is telling us something. It's the most sensitive thing
to fiat liquidity. It only understands how to price fiat credit. It's the antithesis of fiat.
And so if fiat's going to have an issue, Bitcoin's going to scream and shout and tell you about it.
And in my opinion, that's what it has been doing. It's been able to sniff out what it's taking
other markets a long time to sniff out. So, Bitcoin does not lie. Bitcoin is the most
fiat liquidity sense of asset on the planet, which itself has utility value.
It's that within itself is intrinsically valuable. It is number one on the scoreboard
for fiat liquidity sensitivity. Period. No board of directors, no earnings guidance, no balance
sheet to hide behind. It just prices the money supply. It is saying there is not enough credit in the
system to meet the maker that is AI and the sovereign debt crisis around the world. We have issues.
And either everything's going to sell off. We're going to go through the greatest depression we've
ever seen, austerity to new levels. Streets are going to be lit on fire or they're going to print the
money. Either way, Bitcoin wins in the end because it'll outcompete to be the world's money.
Now, my prediction is they're going to print the money. That's historically what they've done.
It's a far sneakier way to default and steal from people. So, Bitcoin leads markets down
in 2000. We had the dot com bust. What was 2000? A productivity shock, a credit event,
they printed the money. Housing crisis, deflation, credit event, they print the money. COVID,
demand collapse, credit event, they print the money. 2026 is it a productivity shock with AI,
a credit event, and they print the money. Either way, they print the money. The question is,
are we going to get this event in 2026 and 2027? When is Bitcoin going to sniff out the other side
of the chasm in which we're crossing? But the point is that I want to get across is they always
print the money. Every credit crisis ends the same way. Monetary expansion. The question is not
if it's when and when they print what wins, the thing you can't make any more of. When there's
an infinite outflow of dollars of fiat. The thing that performs the best is the thing that's
inelastic to this ever flowing supply of fiat. The thing that you cannot make any more no matter
how much more fiat is created. A bunch more fiat is created. Gold miners are going to invest that
and be able to mine gold marginally better. You cannot make any more Bitcoin. And so that's why
it performs the best. It's the best engineered money we've ever come across. Best money mankind,
ever hands down, pound for pound, the champ, the gold medalist, the Bitcoin medalist. So this,
I mean, just to show you guys, US net international investment position is negative 30 trillion.
So again, like if we reach a deflationary crisis and everyone is selling everything to make ends
meet because credit is tight, just a reminder that like the world owns a ton of US assets.
So when South Korea came out with a tax exemption where if you sell US stocks as long as you
reinvest it into the South Korean market, tax free. We're not going to tax you. And so what happens?
A bunch of capital, repatriating out of America and into South Korea. The South Korean stock market
has whipped the S&P 500's ass. Same with Japan, the Japanese stock market is killing the S&P 500.
Asian stock market is killing American stock market. So the pain, if you guys think we've had
paying now, there's 30 trillion dollars more pain to go. The United States cannot afford this and they
know they cannot afford this. If you listen to worse, the new Fed Chair, all he's talking about is AI.
AI this, AI that we got to cut rates. We got to cut rates. We got to cut rates. We got to cut rates.
And so the last thing I want to leave you guys with here is that when people will say, well,
listen, at least President Trump is reshoring. He's bringing infrastructure and manufacturing back
where we're derisking ourselves from China. So this tweet, the USGS report just came out.
A new report from the US Geological Survey reveals that the United States has grown more
reliant on foreign imports of minerals over the past year. Highlighting the increased urgency
to bolster its domestic supply chain. In its annual mineral commodity summary, the USGS found that
the country was 100% import reliant last year for 16 of the non-90 non-fuel commodities that it
tracked. In addition, the US relied more than one half of its apparent consumption for 54 of the
minerals the report showed in comparison in 2024's data, 100% import reliance for 15 commodities
in more than half import reliant for only 46 minerals. So the point that I have for you is the pain
hasn't even started. Do you guys know how, well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I said,
that came out wrong. Pause, pause, pause, rewind. The pain has started in Bitcoin. I know it has. I know
you guys are in some pain. I've seen this movie a million times. We're going to be okay. We're going
to be fine. We're tough. We're the principled, moral soldiers out here fighting the good
ethical fight. We're going to be okay. I know the Bitcoin pain has started, but what I'm saying is
the so reshoring is going to be so inflationary. It's going to be so inflationary. Who's
paying to reshore? Who's paying? Do you know how much money you're going to have to pay someone
to get them to go mine rare earths in Idaho? No one in Manhattan is going to be like, yeah,
I want to move to Idaho to mine rare earths for $20,000 a year. If you pay them $300,000 a year
and free education on how to do it, you might get some people that want to move to Idaho.
It's going to be so inflationary. Commodity prices are going to continue to go up. Oil
probably soon is going to have to start to go up. And so sometimes people say, yeah, but
at least we've made a ton of progress on derisking from China reshoring our manufacturing base.
Uh, according to the US Geological Survey, we haven't not only have we not made any progress,
we've made negative progress. We haven't even started. So we're about to have a credit crisis
because of AI and all sorts of sovereign debt issues and what's going on in Japan.
Mind you, all the actual inflationary pain that we knew was coming from reshoring hasn't even started.
So I'll end it with just some Bitcoin charts. Stay humble and stack sats, guys. So the chart
on the left Bitcoin versus credit spreads. So credit spreads are very low. The the point is
I've talked about it. The business cycle has been down. Bitcoin likes certain market conditions.
It likes easy money. And that's not the market we've been in. We've been in this
difficult monetary conditions. We've been in QT. This has been a very interesting market
market conditions, market environment, monetary environment, liquidity environment. And so it's just
that like if you look at, let me zoom into it. If you look at this chart,
Bitcoin's only behaving naturally. Okay. You can see this spike up here up top and that's around
one Bitcoin made its high and then it's come down. It's come down. Okay. So Bitcoin's going to be fine.
Okay. The next one, this chart has a three of three track record and it just flashed again. This is
the Bitcoin chart ratio, which we've talked about. Look at the chart ratio. It's reaching levels
of historical bottoms. So again, here's the thing you need to ask yourself. Do you think Bitcoin's
going to zero? If you think Bitcoin's going to zero, you're probably not listening to this. And I
wish you well have fun staying poor. If you don't, guys, I love personally. I love moments of
adversity. I love being challenged. I live for it. I love when people on the internet are talking
shit about me accusing me of all the shit. I love it. I bookmark it. I screenshot it. I do.
I swear to God, I'm a sick person in the head. Ask Dylan. I'm sick. I'm deranged. I literally
live for that because that's where growth is. That's where opportunity is. That's where
something inside of you is challenged to find that extra inch. Find that extra dollar. Find that
extra sack. Go that extra mile. That's the story of my career. So I love these moments.
I love it. Shit on Bitcoin. Everyone wants to quit. Everyone's capitulating. I've already been
all in on Bitcoin. I'm going to find every ounce of liquidity. Strikes going to launch every
feature. We're going to stack every sat. You just got to stay humble and keep stacking. This one
commercials are extremely net short Bitcoin. Large speculators are extremely net long. Prior cases
marked bottom processes for Bitcoin. So everything as far as I can tell looks very healthy.
Bitcoin is doing what Bitcoin always does. It's calling bullshit. It's sniffing things out before
they happen. It's very efficient. It's a free market. So turn on your DCAs. This one,
interesting. My quantile models also shows Bitcoin has been cheaper than this level only about
4% of the time across its observable history. So you've only been able to get Bitcoin
cheaper on a relative basis. 4%. So can Bitcoin go down from here? Of course it can. Again,
I have no idea. We could flash down to 30K for a split instant. I have no clue. But if you are here
for the long run, if you're looking to build a war chest for your future family, on the other side
of all this fiat nonsense, of all this garbage, of all this manipulation, central banking,
centrally planned bullshit, if you just want a war chest of time, energy, and saved labor and effort
for your family and your kids, turn on those DCAs. We got no fee, no spread DCAs on strike.
You can DCA for free, convert any percentage of your paycheck for free, and you have free
withdraws to cold storage. I literally told the team, we need to have an ability to stack
sats on the house and withdraw on the house so that we can always say, went and doubt, where the
cheapest place in the world to just securely get yourself some Bitcoin, turn on those DCAs.
And then this other tweet from Frank selling from long-term holders has fallen off a cliff
since Bitcoin corrected to blow 90,000. So the mass of selling is gone. Now again, can Bitcoin
go lower, of course it can. But these are all things that I check for. I've been in this game
for a very long time guys. I'd let you know if I was worried. I'm the opposite of worried. I'm buying.
Okay, that's the end of the AI is causing a credit crisis show. And now we're on to a new segment
that I debuted last week that you guys seemingly liked. What really grinds my gears? Let me take
a sip of espresso. All right, shout out to a shout out to the listener that made this art.
This is hilarious. So for those that don't know, I got this idea from my intuition combined with
family guy. So I did not gain a lot of weight. That's just the Peter Griffin version of me.
And this is the visual for what really grinds my gears. Part one. You don't really grinds my
gears. The clarity act. The market structure bill. Just fucking sign it already or don't sign it.
But shut the fuck up. I'm so sick of seeing Brian Armstrong get in pissy fights. Sissy fights
with these fucking bank CEOs. Jamie Diamond and Brian Armstrong are having a pillow fight
and somehow it's impacting Bitcoin. Let me, let me say something because people say,
Jack, are you worried about the clarity act and not passing? Why would I be worried?
It has nothing to do with Bitcoin. What are they fighting over? For one, they're fighting over
can stable coins pay interest. First of all, who cares? Do Americans not know that they can
download Robinhood or they can download Marcus? You can open any account on your fucking iPhone
and get the fucking get three and a half percent on your cash. Why do you need a stable coin to
get yield on your dollars? Do you guys all on? Do you guys not know that you can do that?
Stable coins did not invent interest on your cash. Did you know that? So what, first of all,
who gives a fuck about whether stable coins can pay interest or not? Nobody cares,
nobody needs it. If people want interest on their cash, they could just download Robinhood.
Why do they need USDC? That's an other thing. Why would I ever use USDC? Ever? For what?
It's, I've, I've had digital dollars. I was born in 1994. I've had digital dollars forever.
Why would I need USDC? It's like, no, no, no, I'm really fighting. I'm, this is what these guys say.
I'm fighting for the American to get interest on their cash. You idiot, that was invented 20
years ago. I'm not, I'm not trying to be hard on anybody. I'm just being honest. That's what
really grinds my gears. I'm seeing these CNBC clips. You know, Jamie Diamond's not letting me pay
interest on cash. You, you're a moron. They've been paying interest on cash for years. Yes,
Jamie Diamond pays one basis point interest on cash. But Robinhood pays four percent interest on cash.
And that's why Robinhood gets customers away from Chase. What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
I'll answer it for you. Nothing. So the people that say, when I talk to reporters and they say,
oh, the Bitcoin market's really reacting to the Clarity Act. That's the Shitcoin Act. This act
has nothing to do, literally, nothing to do with Bitcoin. I don't even know if Bitcoin is mentioned
in it at all. Because the only other thing that they're talking about in this act is moving the
ability to tokenize something away from the SEC and to the CFTC. So they're trying to change
regulators so that they can commit what is effectively securities fraud. And they're trying to
put yield on cash. So what? I could get yield on cash. And just this, it grinds my gears.
Why are we wasting time? One of the biggest thefts in human history is shitcoin and these shitcoin
kings. These guys that run these giant shitcoin casinos spending so much human capital,
human time, effort, attention. Why am I getting dragged into? Why are investors calling me and saying,
are you worried about the Clarity Act? Why the fuck would I be worried about the Clarity Act?
If you want yield on your cash, download Robin Hood. They've been doing this for a long time.
It's called the Fed Funds Rate. I hate to break it to you. But USDC did not invent getting
three and a half percent on your dollars. It didn't. I'm sorry. And then do I worry about whether
tokenizing things is going to be regulated by the SEC or not? No. What the hell does that have
to do with Bitcoin? It has nothing to do with anything productive. Answer me this. This is
only to enrich a bunch of large businesses. This is Coinbase going after regulatory capture.
They're trying to further enrich themselves by taking advantage of a favorable administration,
creating regulatory modes for themselves. This has nothing to do with Bitcoin or any beneficial
efficient productivity for any industry whatsoever. Grines my years to no end.
What are your thoughts on the Clarity Act? I don't know. Just sign Brian Armstrong. Just
fucking sign the thing. So I don't have to hear about it anymore. Or don't sign it. But just the
back and forth. I mean, he goes on TV. I'm really fighting the good fight. I've been in
Washington, D.C. For the last month. How is that fighting for Bitcoin? Being in Washington, D.C.
What the fuck are you doing in Washington, D.C? Are you in for stablecoin yield and wanting to be
regulated by the CFTC? So you can create loads of prediction, market, shitcoin, speculative trash.
Fuck. It's so frustrating. This shitcoin industry. It paints the Bitcoin brand. People legitimately
couple us all together. They do. Like, strike. I'm literally trying to rebuild the financial
on something that's moral and fair and that can last and that serves us all equally. That's
genuinely what I'm trying to participate in. Very humbly. Hey, how can I help? Let me pick up
picks and shovels, baby. Let's get to work. Meanwhile, these guys are in my industry on what planet
like sleeping under Donald Trump's desk, begging him and meanwhile, Jamie Diamonds,
bitching and crying and moaning and calling Brian Armstrong and asshole. Fucking A, man. I mean,
this is how you know it's a bear market. Seriously, what the fuck? Shitcoins are just the
worst. They really are. And you know what, I get less upset over people that get duped into buying
them. Although I'm also, I get upset by that, too. Don't get me wrong. Like, here's what I've
seen these posts recently. Like, oh, the NFT that Logan Paul bought for $2 million is now worth
20 grand. The NFT Justin Bieber bought for $10 million is now worth $50. I've seen these tweets going
around and what's so, it's so frustrating. These guys didn't buy those. They were given those.
Justin Bieber didn't wire anyone a million dollars. These people are such unethical scammers. They're
paying influencers on Instagram to convince a bunch of people that don't know any better into stealing
their money. That's what's happening. So you have a bunch of like unbeknownst to them, retail investors
that think they're buying into the new, um, fucking Leonardo da Vinci art collection and they're
getting completely scammed, knowingly scammed. That doesn't even bother me the most. It doesn't.
Because if you're that stupid, you're kind of had it coming. You're kind of have to touch the
stove and get burned to learn, right? Now again, it doesn't make me not upset. These people are
unethical. They're gross. They're slimy. They're scammers. But if you're that dumb to where you paid
anything more than a penny for a JPEG of a monkey, I mean, you have what's common, okay? But what's
worse is the waste of human capital, not just the money. You've got CNBC all day. You've got news
and media and executives, like some of the biggest companies in the world and our government and
all of our media outlets are covering the Clarity Act. Think about the theft that shit coiners
and shit coins have done to society. What if everyone was just focused on Bitcoin, which was
a fair money that can actually support society in a scalable ethical way? Just picture that for a second.
What if that's where all of our time and our energy and our focus went? So like, hey, let's get AI
and Bitcoin right. Imagine that. You've got people like, I spend my day so much of my day
talking to investors. I don't, I want to see the results of the Clarity Act. You want to see
the results of the Clarity Act? What do you want? Three and a half percent interest on your dollars?
Open a Marcus account. Who gives a fuck about the Clarity Act? Well, you know, I track this
index of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. God, damn it. It's just such an uphill battle.
Unnecessary. We got enough problems, right? Buck. All of our kids are unemployed and like picking up
guns. You want to go lobby president Trump about Dogecoin? I can't even fucking break.
All right, let's move on. You know what else really grinds my gears? When people clip old tweets
of me in the internet, things I just said it and get mad at me. You guys, I didn't just say that.
These clips are years old. Fuck. Here is me. Just trying to have myself a weekend. I'm a Duke
basketball fan, Duke is playing Michigan. The United States is playing for the gold medal hockey.
I want to enjoy time with my girlfriend, watch some sports. My buddy's birthday was on Saturday.
Go to dinner. I open up my phone. Everyone's yelling at me. Everyone's always yelling at me.
Why is everyone yelling at me? Oh, Jack. You said I didn't say that. I said that three fucking
years ago. You have these fucking idiots. Like when I launched 21 and someone said,
how much Bitcoin do you want to buy at 21? And my answer was, I don't know as much Bitcoin as we
could possibly buy. That's everyone's logical answer. You moron. What was I supposed to say in
actual number? Oh, now that you ask, we only want 122,931.37 BTC. No more than that. What the fuck?
Of course, everyone wants to own as much Bitcoin as they can possibly own. What type of stupid
fucking question is that? So I give the only logical answer. I want to own as much Bitcoin as
possible. And then you have these clip farming accounts on Twitter that just exist to get views
and in site rage bait. And they're tweeting videos of me from years ago. And some of you idiots
are out there that watch these clips every day. And it's the same fucking clips. They're tweeting
the same clips. And you're like, Jack just was on TV saying they're going to buy all this
Bitcoin, even though 21 hasn't done shit. You fucking idiot. I did not just say that. It drives me nuts.
And maybe some of these grinds, my gears aren't relatable because some of you guys don't face
this issue. But whatever, I don't care. This is my show. I don't give a shit. It drives me nuts.
And if you guys, like I said, when Bitcoin gets in a bear market, people get pissed at me. It's just
I've said it before. It's the man in the arena. All right. It comes with the territory. It's much
easier to blame this 31 year old in the empty closet that you feel like you know and you know well
enough to yell at and criticize and be mean to. It's much easier to blame me than it is to
blame yourself. I get it. And it's kind of grown on me a little bit over the years. In bear markets,
you guys don't like my hair. You don't like my closet. You don't like my voice. You don't like the way
I look. You don't like anything about me in bear markets. Some of you. And it's kind of grown on me
because we have this love hate relationship. It's like, what's the what's the economic,
what's the economic public figure version of sexual tension? So like we got this tension going on.
And things are bad. You hate my guts when things are good. You want to take pictures.
It's I kind of it's grown on me. But like what the fuck you guys? You're like,
it's like people are posting like baby photos of me. Like Jack just said it's like I did not just say that.
I did not say that. Whenever there's a video of me, especially when I look like five years younger,
I mean, look at this video of me. I have a tan. I have a tan. I've like a shaved head.
And I look a decade younger. It kid drives me nuts. You've got these micro strategy shareholders
that are like, hey, idiot, you said you were going to buy Bitcoin. You didn't buy Bitcoin.
I didn't just say that. I said that years ago. More on. So anyways, this guy posts this video
where I say in it. Anyone that understands Bitcoin doesn't take 1% of their portfolio and use it as a
hedge. I still believe in that. If you actually understand Bitcoin, it's not 1% of your portfolio.
You don't just dip your toe in. If you understand all this stuff, you buy some fucking sats.
And the internet went ape shit on me. Get a load of this fucking asshole. Bitcoin's now in 65
percent. Who's he to say to? I did it. I said this three years ago, two years ago,
whatever. Fuck. God damn it. It pains me how stupid people are. It's like the same thing. It's the
same group of people that I went off on last week that are telling me how to use my Bitcoin.
Don't take out a loan. What are you doing? Shot the fuck up. Got these people. Just doomsgrowing
Twitter all day. Bitcoins having some red candles. Bitcoins in a bear market. You got these
angry motherfuckers. Doomsgrowing Twitter all day. Just looking to get wound up and just pile on
guys like me. Fuck off. I hate God damn it. I mean, I kind of love it. I have to admit, I kind of
love it. I have a love hate relationship with it. Sometimes I'm like, do these idiots know
that I did not just say that, that I said that five years ago, that there are Twitter accounts
that just post clips of me from like years ago. But then sometimes it cracks me up. Sometimes
I get a kick out of it. So anyway, that's what grind my years. And the last thing that grinds
my years this week is just Canada, just like all of Canada, like be better. And I'm half kidding.
So I can already see the Canadians in the chat like, come on man, that's so mean. Come on,
it's just a joke, but kind of like, let's just admit it. Canada grinds all of our gears.
And is it hold on? Is it Justin Trudeau that is dating Katy Perry?
Yeah, I mean, come on. So Justin Trudeau tweets, you can't take our country and you can't take our
game. And then we whip their ass and like, he's out boating with Katy Perry. I mean, Canada is just
the worst. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, because strikes not in Canada yet. And we want to be there.
We want to serve everyone. And I've actually been to Canada a few times. And I don't hate Canada.
I like Canada. And Canada has some great Bitcoiners, shout out France, shout out Bull Bitcoin.
Great Bitcoiners. I don't hate Canada. But come on. I mean, you guys couldn't beat us in hockey.
And you've got Justin Trudeau just sounding like a giant was running around just
caking it with Katy Perry. I don't know. Just a, I'll say this. Just a tough, tough scene for Canadians.
Just a tough scene. It really is. I mean, it's just got to be tough waking up Canadian today.
Just a tough scene. I don't know what else to put it. Just a tough scene for Canadians out there.
Thoughts and prayers are with you guys. Okay, strike. I posted this on Nostra earlier.
Um, I think we got about a week or so. Maybe a little more until we start rolling out our
line of credit externally. So this is a screenshot of me on my phone setting up my line of credit.
I just wanted to talk about the product again, specifically, because some people, I posted this on
Nostra and some people were like, look at this guy. It's a little, he's giving more people away to
Look at this dude. Look at this dude. Look at this guy. He's captured by the state and he's giving us
all more ways to borrow against our Bitcoin. And this is not what the godfather said. The site for
bumps would have ever wanted. Okay, listen up. Doofus. This is why the line of credit is cool. Okay.
Right now, the only credit product in Bitcoin are these 12 month loans. Okay, which are fine?
And they serve their purpose. If you have a large tax bill, I had one of those. And I got a 12 month
loan on strike. If you are getting married, you'd find it's a wedding. You're buying a new house.
You're starting a new business. You take out a large chunk of capital. You lock in the term for 12
months. So it's not a variable rate or anything. And you deploy that capital. You're able to plan
ahead. You're going to say, hey, I want to finance my wedding collateralized by Bitcoin. I'm going
to pay it back over this duration, because I'm calculating my salary. And I'm calculating what my
bonus is going to be. And that works. But what it doesn't really do is it's not the best way to
live on Bitcoin. The dream for me is I get my paycheck. I converted into Bitcoin. I am able to
live on Bitcoin without selling it and pay my bills. And so what the line of credit is is instead
of taking out a large lump sum of capital at once in needing to use it for 12 months,
you are just drawing the capital that you need when you need it. So let me give you guys a concrete
example. Let's say I'm keeping 10 to 20% of my Bitcoin stack on strike. And I want to do live on that
by borrowing against a little bit of it. But if I do 50% LTV loan and then Bitcoin goes through a
bear market like it is. And I got to go post more collateral. I risk a margin call. I'm borrowing
a large lump sum of cash all at once. And that's what ends up stressing people out and getting
people in trouble is they're like, what if the price goes down? There's going to be a margin call.
There's a chance I'm going to get liquidated. That's really, it really makes me lose sleep.
I'm doing math. I'm doing numbers. I feel uncomfortable. And I understand that. I genuinely understand
that. And I'm not trying to put anyone in that position. And so I came up with this idea for the line
because it actually suits my use case. My predominant use case. I do have large tax bills and
one-off expenses every now and then. But my predominant use case is what I want is I have, you know,
like I said, let's say some small fraction of my Bitcoin stack on strike. And I have bill pay hooked
up on strike. And the line of credit is just a payment method. So when a bill comes in that strike
is going to pay because I have it all hooked up. Strike has an account and a routing number.
When a bill comes in, I say I want my line of credit to pay that bill. And so what strike does is it
takes, it borrows a little bit of credit against my stack of Bitcoin and pays the bill for me.
So let's say I'm making numbers up. Let's say my credit card is $5,000 a month. My mortgage is $2,500 a month.
And my comment bill is $50 a month in my HWA is $100 a month. So I'm looking at around $8,000
of monthly expenses. Okay. Let's say that. So strike would pay those for me against my line of credit.
So then at the end of the month when I've paid all the bills, I don't have 50% LTV in this giant
loan that I need to manage and if Bitcoin's price goes down, I'm risk of margin call. I got to add
more collateral. I'm sweating about liquidation. Instead, my LTV is like 1% because my LTV is
only big as my monthly expenses. And I mean, hopefully you guys aren't spending 50% of your
net worth every month, right? And then I have direct deposit set up on strike and my direct deposit
comes in and I can decide. Well, I want 50% of my direct deposit to go towards paying down my line
of credit. I want the other 50% to buy Bitcoin. Or I went all of my direct deposit to go towards
paying down my line of credit. But then I'm able to, hey, Bitcoin's down, Bitcoin's dipping.
I'm going to allow my line of credit to grow to 10% LTV. Or I'm going to allow my line of credit
but that way, 1% 5% 10% LTV. You're nowhere near risk of liquidation. It's much healthier
environment for you. And it's a much easier way to live your life on Bitcoin. You don't want
a 12 month loan. You want a dynamic forever rolling line of credit against the stash of Bitcoin.
You've got your direct deposit hooked up, which allows you to finance this stuff in real time.
And you've got bill pay hooked up. So you just spend on credit cards, hook your bill pay up to your
mortgage, your HOA, your comment, your electricity, your credit card, all the stuff that you need.
And you live your life on this evolving line of credit that, you know, when they print the money,
Bitcoin's going to explode. And so these are the tools that allow me to own more Bitcoin than I
otherwise would because I'm stacking more Bitcoin than I otherwise would. And I'm not selling as much
Bitcoin as I'd otherwise have to living on zero. It's a life hack. Like strike is like a bank account
from the future. And so I'm really excited about this. I want you guys to be able to ask questions.
Because the other thing is, I don't think there's been a lot of innovation in the Bitcoin credit space.
Like everyone that offers Bitcoin back loans just does the same 12% and a lot of our pricing is similar,
you know, we've tried to innovate and like, okay, well, let's do unique liquidations.
Where our liquidation is not going to, we're not going to liquidate your whole position at once. We're
only going to liquidate tiny little bits if we absolutely have to to get you back into a healthy state.
Because we want the price to eventually recover and we want you to have as much Bitcoin as possible.
So there's a little tiny innovation. But I consider this line of credit a massive innovation
because you don't have to take out a large 12 month loan. You can operate under these tiny bite size
lines of credit, which are really, really useful to maximizing the Bitcoin you own in living your
life saving in Bitcoin. I think the future we're moving towards is you save in Bitcoin and you're
going to have to spend in fiat because we're not on a Bitcoin standard yet. And this is an incredibly
powerful tool. This is like life on steroids. And then things like liquidation proof loans,
which we should be coming out with in Q2. So we'll have a loan. It's going to cost you more
because obviously it's a lot more work for us to provide for you. But we'll offer you a loan where
there's no such thing as liquidation at all. So we're going to come out with more and more
innovative stuff. Really, really excited about it. Really excited about it. So anyways,
if you guys have questions about this, I'd be really curious to know because I'm going to start
recording all the content and writing the blog post and stuff to promote it. And I'm kind of curious.
Like, doesn't make sense to you guys? Do you understand it? What would be useful? Do you want to see
a tutorial of how I use it and how I live my life? Or just like, let me know what you guys think
and what would be the most useful for you. And then 21, I know many of you are going to hate it.
But we're working on announcing stuff. It's difficult. I mean, in the public markets, it's difficult.
Obviously, listen, like what I'll say is like, obviously, if I could rewind time, I do so much
differently. There's no doubt about that. And I own that entirely. I mean, here's something I'll
also say, people that it's, I find it interesting that there are entrepreneurs out there
and CEOs out there that try and take shots at me. And I get it because a lot of people's
marketing strategies are to convince everyone that I'm a bad person or that I'm a criminal
or that my products suck. It's like, that's literally their marketing strategies. Be like,
use us because strike is this and this or because jack is this and this. And so that's how
they market their products. But building stuff is hard. And like, there's a lot of entrepreneurs
and CEOs out there that know that. And so, yes, like, if we did not do this order of operations
perfect, there's no doubt about that. If I could rewind time, I would have done a lot differently.
But, I mean, I stand 10 toes down. And like, there is no equity at this price level. I'd rather
own. I am, I am ball's deep in in what we're building. I mean, we're trading at like a 27% discount
to the Bitcoin on our balance sheet, which doesn't make any sense. You've got my self-tether
and soft bank in over 43,000 Bitcoin. And it's trading as if Bitcoin's 47k. Which, whatever,
I mean, hey, I would love to announce stuff we're working on and then buy our own stock back.
I mean, I would be buying our own stock personally if I was allowed to. I'm not allowed to
be right now. So, I mean, if you guys want to keep it this low, that's fine. I'm a buyer,
when I'm allowed to be a buyer. But, yeah, I mean, when you put Tether soft bank in I, all in the same
team. And you guys know how we feel about the market and Bitcoin Treasury companies and stuff.
Bitcoin Treasury companies are fine. They can exist and we'll see how well they do.
We believe in having a Bitcoin Treasury, one of the biggest in the world, and an incredible
Bitcoin company. And so, yeah, operating in the public markets is tough, man. I've learned a lot.
But green pastures ahead, skies are blue. I'm pumped. I really am. And I'm at the point where
I've taken such a beating that you can't hurt me anymore. Keep throwing punches. You're like,
man, this guy's not flinching anymore. You guys can, I mean, I read every troll, I book Mark
Mall. I like I said, I'm a psychopath. It just gets me going. It really drives me. I'm a psychopath.
And I'm just very excited for what we got cooking. That's all I can say, though. And for some
of you that's frustrating. Sorry. I'm just falling the rules. All right, let's do some Q&A
longer episode. But, um, I don't know. You guys asked for the longer episodes. So, so, um,
that's what you get. You want long episodes. You get long episodes. Okay, let's see here.
Oh, so it's a blow on my face up. Look at those blue eyes, ladies pause. I'm taking now.
But these are Fiji, blue water. I mean,
sheesh, blue-eyed bandit. Let me just get it. I'm gonna get roasted for that on the internet.
Look, this guy's talking about his eyes. Meanwhile, have you seen this stock price?
Shut the fuck up. All right, why should we work for something another man can create for free?
I have a feeling that's not a legitimate question. You're just paraphrasing my quote,
agree. Next. Question for Jack, please, Dylan. If AI destroys wage leverage faster, then governments
can inflate it away, does Bitcoin become wage insurance? Yeah, I mean, we're gonna have to wait and
see how Bitcoin does. I mean, let's say Bitcoin just repeats its COVID performance.
It is a leading indicator. It's sniffed out COVID and how bad it really was. And then it was the
best performer on the other side of the big print. If it just repeats that, what's happening right
now? So you're looking at indicators like the RSI, certain cohorts of Bitcoin holders,
capitulating and selling. It's all looking like the 2020 crash. It's all, you know, this price level
is severe capitulation, oversold metrics. Bitcoin is clearly sniffing out some credit crunch,
some concern. And then if they print a lot of money, which presumably they would unless they
want the entire system in America as we know it's a collapse, then Bitcoin's gonna be the best
performer. Something that I'm interested in is this time. What's different about this time is this
time, the American stock market is under a lot of pressure. I mean, the US has written papers on
how they want capital to leave America. They want capital flight. They want stronger foreign
markets in a weaker dollar, right? And so I'm curious to see if this is the cycle where Bitcoin
starts to separate from its correlation to the NASDAQ. We'll see. Because if AI is here to at least
for now, destroy the multiple on software, destroy the multiple on big tech in the Mac 7,
then maybe Bitcoin actually finally starts to trade as its own unique asset. But we'll have to
see the proof will be in the pudding. One day that will happen is my assumption is that is it time?
I don't know. Maybe it might be because you're seeing lots of endowments, lots of sovereigns.
You're seeing the ETF disclosures look really good. I mean, a lot of huge capital is adding
to their positions as the price comes down. So the ETFs are not puking Bitcoin. They're not
capitulating. All this large smart money is just buying more. Individuals are owning less Bitcoin
believe it or not. Corporations, government. I mean, everyone with large capital pools are acquiring.
So maybe Bitcoin starts behaving more like gold slowly and starts to diverge from the NASDAQ.
But we'll see. We'll see. Question for Dylan and Jack, since Bitcoin rises with inflation,
how do you see the deflationary pressures of AI impacting the Bitcoin price?
Yes, so I kind of talked about this. Deflation will initially harm Bitcoin because
it's hard on credit in what we're seeing. So it will be harmful. It's, but by the way, in a
deflationary crisis, everything sells off. If we go through like a true deflationary crisis,
and we have a day, a week, a month of extreme bond volatility, the VIX spikes. Credit spreads go
haywire. If we see that and we legitimately see that, by the way, gold too will sell off like crazy.
Everything will sell off. It's a sell everything, hunker down, get in your bunker.
And then, you know, things like gold and Bitcoin should in theory rally. So nothing is immune,
by the way, just to be clear. A crisis is a crisis. There's no safe place to hide.
Pain is pain. You're going to have to feel it. No one gets out, scotch free.
So what, you know, Bitcoin's bear market so far and the pain it's felt since October 10th or
whatever. It's, it's probably because there's a credit crisis brewing.
Delinquencies are up. Joblessness is up. White collars getting hammered.
The youth is getting hammered. Yes, not good. I mean, stock market now is getting hammered.
Do you think AI agents will start using Bitcoin to manage financial tasks?
I doubt traditional finance will work well on such a digital use case.
Um, yeah, I would assume Bitcoin is the money of the future. But I think that for a variety of
reasons. I'm not like hypersold on this narrative. I think people are pushing this narrative because
I think they're pushing the narrative for the wrong reasons. Like I think they're pushing the
narrative because they feel like mainstream media and the legacy financial system is going to
eat it up. Like they're they're tweeting like, imagine what currency clawed box is planning on
you showing. No one, like, come on guys. Like nobody actually gives a fuck. Like if your clawed
bot is like sending each other micro payments for what for shit posting like for deleting all of your
fucking hardware data. Like, I don't know. Yeah, obviously, yes. I think in a future where AI agents
need to transact, they will use Bitcoin because they don't need permission. How would an AI agent
sign up for strike sign up for a bank account? Like, it's impossible. Um, I don't they can't use
JP Morgan Chase. They can't you like, so they will need programmable money. And most importantly,
they will need money where they don't need permission. People say, oh, they'll use stable coins.
Will they, though? Because what if there are AI agents that are doing all sorts of AI
shit for kiddie porn? Our stable coins are going to be used for that use case two. So AI,
stable coins just to be clear guys, you guys need to know this. You need permission to use stable
coins. Case you didn't know that. There's a lot of things people don't know about stablecoins.
Like, they didn't invent yield on cash. And they also, like, they are permissioned money.
They're just different versions of dollars. So when people say like, AI agents won't use Bitcoin,
they'll use stablecoins. Uh, okay. We'll see how well that goes. Until USDC sanctions a bunch of
AI agents. Um, whatever. Anyways, uh, but my point is, I'm I'm far more interested in all of the
macro stuff and that they have to print so much money and that Bitcoin is this finite supply asset
for an ungodly amount of capital and that there is an entire generation that is demoralized and hopeless
and that we have an opportunity to like build a better future that we actually believe in.
The AI agent stuff will come, but I think it's similar to a lot of the early lighting that
work stuff I got caught in, where I was really excited to integrate it into all the retail stores and,
you know, disruptive visa. And I was early. And I think we're going to find ourselves to be early to
AI agents adopting Bitcoin in like a major, major, major way. But we'll see. Hopefully I'm wrong. I
hope I'm wrong. What narrative is left after digital gold? I don't know. I mean, I'm a narrative
guy. I guess because I go on TV and I talk about Bitcoin and they're always into the narratives
and so I kind of have to play the narrative game. But, you know, to be candid with you guys, I'm
not a narrative guy. I think it's really simple. Money's compete. You contribute time and energy
effort labor. You got to store it somewhere. Where's the best place to store it? And that's not like a
opinionated. That's not like a well, my favorite color is blue and your favorite color is yellow and
his favorite color is green. That's not it's a well, which one's scarcer, which one's easier to store,
which one's easier to transfer, which one's more divisible. But like Bitcoin is just pound for pound,
the best money period. And like candidly, that's all that matters. It doesn't really matter.
Now, what narratives are going to be adopted by people? I don't know. Sure, you want, you want
Bitcoin to be the money for AI agents, whatever. Fine. Is that how it becomes a $30 trillion asset? No,
comes a $30 trillion asset because it's the scariest thing that we've ever come across as a species,
the only thing as finite as Bitcoin is life itself. That's what there's only thing that matters
in regards to the price. Price of anything is very simply put supply to man. The supply can't move.
So anyway, I don't know, I'm not a narrative guy. Not like one of these guys. It's like,
ooh, let me spend all day thinking about some story that everyone will believe.
I mean, no, give me wrong. When I go on CNBC and they want to talk to me about narrative,
they're going to ask me about quantum, all this bullshit. I'm happy to play the part to hopefully
move the needle in the direction it needs to go. It's the best thing you can own.
Period. And if it's too volatile for you now, then you're not going to get the returns. It has now.
It's returns will go down over time because volatility will go down over time. So if you can't take
the heat, stay out of the kitchen. You can't take the volatility. You don't get the returns.
Eventually, everyone will own Bitcoin. Will that be within my lifetime? I'm not sure, but I don't know.
It's just the best money. It's just, it's as simple as that. You said Bitcoin back
loans in Europe would have a 10K minimum, but in Portugal, it's still 75K. Well, that limit drops
when you launch a BTC line of credit will Portugal be included in the rollout.
Not all of our European countries have 10K. Unfortunately, Portugal is obviously one of the
ones that did not get the 10K. It's just difficult math regulations. It kills me. I wish
everything I built. I could just give to whoever wanted it. Imagine that world. Imagine a world
where fucked. Like, I just build stuff. And whoever wants to use it could use it.
Instead, I'm like, I got to get permission to take a piss. It's crazy. I mean, in the public markets,
who knows? I'm going to end up, they're going to end up meeting like my blood panel. It's crazy.
So yeah, I'm sorry about that. The Portugal regulators and regulations are different,
and it doesn't mean we're not working on it. It's safe to say that if I don't serve you as a
customer today, I'm working on it. Whether that's limits, opening an account, lending.
So we're working on it. I'm sorry about that. And the line of credit is going to be US first,
but we're going to try and get it. Same as all of our other products. We try and start small,
do some testing, ensure that the product quality is high. We don't want to launch something that
gives people issues. That's not worth it. Low time preference. So we'll launch it in a few
select US states starting next week, probably. And then we'll go from there. And our goal will be
to get it to, of course, Europe and the rest of the world as fast as possible. Question, hey Jack,
when can we expect to have yield on cash account available? I'm so ready to dump my savings account.
No timeline at the moment, but it's a top priority, super top priority. It's a little bit more
complicated than you'd think. So taking us a little bit more work to get it to a place where we
can start to have a timeline and tease it a little bit more. But it's coming, hopefully within
the coming months. It's certainly not like at the end of this year. Now no promise is obviously
there's only so much I can control. But from what I can tell in the progress we've made already,
it should be fairly soon or niche or fairly soon. Question for Jack, why for Bitcoin,
backline of credit would there be minimums when it's secured by money? There's platforms like
lava. Well, lava is not legal. They're not doing legal things.
Yeah, I mean, listen, it's hard to be compared to other companies that aren't following the rules.
Like part of strike and being one of the most trusted and best Bitcoin financial services in the
world is that we follow the rules. We're not going to get you and us in trouble.
Nobody wants that. And so, can't speak for other companies, but we follow the rules.
The line of credit minimum, by the way, will be really low, like thousands of dollars,
a couple grand, five grand, something like that. But there are rules, unfortunately.
And there are companies that don't follow the rules. But the problem is, eventually, you get caught.
Breaking the rules is not like a scalable business model. Uh-huh. So, you know,
we're very regulated and licensed. And I know people will say, oh, you KYC cook.
But I mean, what do you want me to do? I can't change the world from a prison cell.
I can't, I can't build you guys products and have fun on the show sitting behind bars.
So I got all the rules. And I can only make progress moving the world in what I think is the
right direction by falling the rules. So, yeah, that's all I'll say.
Dylan, we'll strike the offering checking and savings accounts with debit slash credit cards.
Bitcoin businesses don't have a Bitcoin bank option to run these services businesses need
access to these services. Eventually, we will. It's not something we're actively focused on at the
moment. And one of the primary reasons for that is because we, I don't know. I just don't know
that you guys need a card from us yet. We'll see. But with the line of credit, like if you have
an MX card, you're probably getting all these amazing rewards. I don't know. Do you, um, do you need
a card from us? Use your MX. Just use your line of credit to pay off the MX. So you've got
direct deposit. You can pay bills. You can buy sell Bitcoin. You've got line of credit,
termed loans. You're good. You should be good. We'll see though. Like, you guys will use the
service. And then if, if it's not given you what you need, we'll build whatever you want. But I'm curious
to see if people use it correctly. I don't think you need a card from us. I don't know. I don't know.
If a card is such a fiat product, I'll build it if I have to. But still still want feedback from
you guys on that one. I'm not sold. Jack, simple question. Does strike run its money transfer
transactions primarily on Tether or Bitcoin? Bitcoin? We don't run anything on Tether. I mean,
we support USDT in our, in the version of strike. So you guys that are using strike in America
in UK in EU, you're using strike that has support for the the dollar or the euro or the pound,
wherever you are, your jurisdiction. Strike in Latin America and in Africa. Instead of their
local currency, it has Tether because people in Nigeria, they don't want Naira. They want USDT.
So we support USDT like that. But our money transfers like our send globally product or cross
currency stuff. It's all on Bitcoin. Now, people try and lie about me all the time. And I know
that that's a frequent lie. Like Jack, Jack's friends with Tether and he secretly running his company
on Tether. I'm not. I'm not. A question. When will Michigan be available for the line of credit
product that you'll launch? Michigan will not be one of the first states. But it could be weeks
after it could be whatever we want. We're going to roll it out semi-selectively and just see how it goes.
First, because I'm not sure people understand it. I'm really curious how we were going to use it.
I want to make sure it's an unbelievable experience like one that I've been bragging about.
And then I'm just going to flip the switch and turn on everywhere. So there's no like explicit
timeline. There's no rules about that. That's the subjective decision I'm making,
which is we want to roll it out the right way. Low time preference. You guys are going to kick my
ass. Because there's going to be people on Twitter that are like holy shit. My life's changed.
I get this line of credit. So there's such a unique Bitcoin product. I'm so excited about it.
And people are going to be tweeting about it. And then some people aren't going to have access to it.
And I'm going to get my ass handed to me. People don't be like, hey, turn it on for me. Fuck you.
But I trust me. I think it's the right thing to do. You just never want to do a
it's a totally new product. It's a first of its kind. You don't want to blast it out to everybody.
All at once. At least in my opinion. When is strike coming to Canada? We are working on Canada.
It's just brutal man. Canada grinds my gears. The regulatory environment over there is
painful. So it's going to take us time. Unfortunately. But we're working on it.
Strike question, Dylan. Please update us on UK personal loans. Also is Jersey channel island
counted within UK or is a separate domicile? I don't have an update for UK personal loans for you
on this mailback Monday. I don't know what Jersey channel is. Maybe if you write into support
or DM us or something, we'll get back to you on the specific set. Is that like a region of the,
I don't know what that is. Sorry. But we're working on the personal loans in the UK as well.
We are. That one's more straightforward than Canada. We'll get there. Dylan, we'll strike
be offering business solutions for Bitcoin businesses. We don't want to use TradFive Bank
for checking. We want to use a Bitcoin bank. So we do offer these products for businesses.
So we have bill pay for businesses. We have lending for businesses. We'll have line of credit for
businesses. So you get an account in routing number with strike. You can wire money in. You can send
money out. You can pay bills. I think our line of credit for businesses is going to be massive.
Imagine if you're a Bitcoin miner. You have bills to pay. You're mining Bitcoin. You need to
pay your electricity bill. You might not want to sell your Bitcoin at the lows right now. Just
hook up your bill pay to the bills that you got to cover for your mining services. Collateralize
it against the sats on your balance sheet and handle your bills that way. It's like an absolute game
changer. Huge. So yeah, I don't know. What the confusion is here. But we support businesses.
If you're a business and you want to talk to us or you need any help, just reach out.
I mean, we've onboarded thousands and thousands of businesses all over the world. And our business
product is actually growing a lot, which is exciting. I think the line of credit is going to be huge
too. If I'm a business, I mean, strike the business uses. It uses line of credit too. Like let's say
we need a license in Canada. And it's a million dollars. Okay. We have over 1,500 Bitcoin on our
balance sheet, which is what is that right now? It's a lot less than it was in October. I'll tell you
that much. So that's a hundred million dollars. We have a hundred million dollars of Bitcoin on
our balance sheet. Would I use a line of credit to get a million dollar license or would I sell
Bitcoin off our treasury or take the profits? So let's say we're making millions of dollars a month.
Would I take some of that and pay for the license? Maybe. But I might just take that by the dip
and have an LTV of like 1% getting the license in Canada with the line of credit. And then I'd pay
down that million dollar line of credit over the next 12 months. I'm taking maybe a hundred
grant a month of our profits and allocating it and paying it down. But in that way, I'm allowing
myself to buy the dip. It's just like the line of credit is just a beast. I think businesses are
going to love it. I think Bitcoin miners are going to love it. If my state is slow to allow lending
Washington, would you expect it to be slow to approve the line of credit? No. No. We'll get you.
No. Shouldn't be. Hey Jack, question for strike. I see an extra layer pin protection before
hitting sender withdrawal. It would be nice to have that layer so that I can send larger UTXO
to cold storage. What do you mean by that? So we do have that feature.
Well, I can't tell the, I can't tell what the question is. We, so you see the feature. I see an
extra layer pin protection. Yeah. So we have this feature where if you guys want extra security
on your account, you can do it where you need to enter the pin or do some form of authentication
to send Bitcoin off the app if you want. If you want that level of security, we have that.
So if you need that, you can just turn it on in your settings.
Okay. Um, last question. Other, am I a cat guy? A dog guy or neither? We all know you're a bear guy.
I'm not a cat guy. I'm allergic to cats or I don't know. At least I was when I was a kid.
Like my eyes get all irritated and stuff. So I'm definitely not a cat guy. Am I a dog guy?
Yeah. Humans are dog guys. There's just the man's best friend, right? There's no doubt about that.
But I had a bad experience with a dog. It was actually with Dylan. I'm going to rag on Dylan a little
bit. Sorry, not sorry. Dylan and I got a dog when we were living together. Like when was that?
Almost 10 years ago. Dylan and I got a dog. And we were young. And we were like 23 or something.
Young. This was like before I found it strike, but like right before. Like I was open source lightning
network developer. And Dylan and I got a dog. And Dylan was always out partying in the clubs.
And I'm not exaggerating. I'm being dead ass. Dylan was like the coolest, coolest guy in town who's
going all the clubs, like ladies love Dylan. It's like running around the city, having fun. Whatever is 23.
Whatever. I was literally working on open source Bitcoin software all day all night in our apartment.
And so we get this dog. And Dylan doesn't take care of the dog. Dylan's fucking running around,
booze in, chasing women. I'm trying to focus on the lightning network and building the future financial
system. And I have this fucking dog all by myself. And I'm like, bro, I can't take care of this dog all by
myself. He's like, sorry, man, I'm busy. So meanwhile, the dog ends up hating me because I kind of
refresh rate with the dog. The dog shitting all over the house. The dog. It was a mess. I was too
young to have a dog bad situation. Dylan bailed on me with the dog. He's probably in the chat. Like
that's what happened. This is the same apartment when I had the painting that I got for six
bit coin. But then Bitcoin obviously appreciated. So it became a six figure painting technically.
And he's bringing home chicks from the club. Like, yeah, you know, this is six figure painting.
We got on the wall. It was that apartment. We had a fucking dog. And so I'm a dog guy. Now,
you're going to ask what happened to the dog. Is the dog okay? Yes, the dog is great. Once I realized
the situation was bad, like the utter and complete gentleman that I am, I was like, okay, this
it was a golden retriever. It's like this golden retriever has to go find a farm. It needs,
I didn't have a yard. It was a tiny little apartment in Chicago. I didn't have a big closet like this.
I had no room for this fucking dog. Chew it up the couch, shitting everywhere. I'm trying to
try to understand how the lightning network works. This thing is just like causing mayhem,
Dylan's out at the club. So I find a farm for this dog and give the dog to a new owner
that I knew through a friend. It's on a farm and the dog lives in incredible life,
thinks still life running around a farm. Amazing. So that's my dog experience. I plan on having a dog
someday. But I learned my lesson. I don't know if I'm ready for it. I got to focus right now.
I got to focus right now. We're in the belly of the beast right now. My first goal is to get engaged
and get married and have kids. That's my foot before I get a dog. I want to be a dad so bad and not
of a dog. My dream is to be a dad. Anyways, not a cat guy. I'm a dog guy and a blue devil guy.
The only sports team I like as much as the Chicago Bears and the bulls are probably the
Duke Blue Devils. White socks, bears, bulls, Duke. My dad went to Duke. I didn't go to college.
I made die hard Duke basketball fan. I can't watch Duke games in public. And everyone that knows
me knows that. That's not a that's a known fact. Like, oh, if Duke is playing can't invite
Jack to stuff. He can't leave his house. And so beating Michigan, I mean, Michigan fans are the worst.
I mean, just shoving a sock and Dave Portland was mouth. So I'm not a cat guy. I'm a dog guy,
a Bears guy, and a blue devil. All right, this episode is officially run two hours. So
Dylan texted me that he's sending in his two weeks notice. Hold on, which part of that? Would you
push back on, Dill? It's not an insult. God forbid your friend gets on a show with 50,000 subscribers
and says you got a lot of chicks and we're running around having a good time. God forbid.
Dylan was killing it. I mean, what do you what? Like what? Which part of that was? Let's see. I'm
waiting for his response. Which part of that was bad? You guys know how we roll on this show.
We prioritize the truth and nothing short of the truth. Dylan said he took care of the dog,
walked him every day after work, and he loved Dylan. Yeah, debatable, debatable that
whatever waste of time for the internet. Let it be known that Dylan took care of the dog when he
got home from the club. He took the dog for a walk. All right, with that, I'm out of here, guys.
Let me pull up the chat and see any last minute things. You have for me. Nothing. All right, guys.
Dylan, it's Jack could have said Dylan was bringing dudes back to the apartment. See,
that's what I'm saying, guys. You can't be so cynical. God forbid, your boy says, yeah, when we're
living together, he was running around chasing tail, having a good time. What I could have said is
Dylan was running around. The dog's name was Finn after health, Finn.
All right, I'm out of here. I'll see you guys next week as always. Leave a comments questions
in the comments section. I read them all. Let me know how I can make the show better. Was this too
long? Did the topics resonate? Did it make sense? What do you think of our line of credit
product? How can I help you? And with that, I'm out of here. Peace and love. Take care of yourself.
Turn on your DCA's. Bye.
