Later on, you'll hear more about the Fundrise Income Fund and why sophisticated investors are turning to higher yielding assets like private credit. But for now, let's get into today's interview. In this interview, I'm speaking to the turning point master himself, Milton Berg. Nine months ago, Milton came on Monetary Matters with an extraordinarily bullish case for US stocks, which are now up nearly 20% since that interview. Our talk today is very technical and quite long. So I wanna give you a little bit of a roadmap. The first 20 minutes or so, we devote to the incredibly strong buy signals that Milton saw in April, 2025, that nearly one year later are still motivating his analysis. At the 22 minute mark, Milton talks about the disturbing December signal that made him short the market. At the one hour and 12 minute mark, we talk about why Milton is bearish on gold and silver and why he thinks that late January was a climax top for precious metals. At the one hour and 37 minute mark, Milton talks about Bitcoin. And just over two hours in, we talk about the vicious selloff in stock for stocks. I also wanna make clear that this interview was recorded on February 6th. And at that time, Milton in his model portfolio for institutional clients had combined short positions of over 100% in the S&P, Nasdaq, Russell, as well as semiconductors. Based on what he saw Monday, February 9th, not only did he cover those shorts, but he also flipped long equities. Again, that is for his institutional clients. In his new retail service for individual investors, Milton's signal has had a 100% long exposure to stocks since early April, 2025. Also, when it comes to precious metals, Milton shorted gold and silver within one day of the high in precious metals at the end of January, and he remains bearish on gold and silver. Let's get into it. Got a very special guest. I'm joined once again by the extremely accomplished technician known as Milton Berg of MB Advisors and Milton Berg Edge. Milton, it is wonderful to see you. How are you? I'm doing very well. Thank you so much. Good to see you again, Jack. Always enjoy interviewing with you. The feeling is mutual. Milton, about eight or nine months ago, shortly after the seismic panic in markets of April, 2025, you and I did an interview and you were extremely emphatic that the market, the technical signals in the market you were seeing were extremely strong and you used extremely strong language. This time I said, we have a series of buy signals. There's no way the market could go down. It's definitely gonna go up. How long it goes, I don't know, because you had similar signals in 1987 in January and the market peaked three quarters of a year later. So I can't tell you how long the market's going to rally, but I will tell you how high the market should go. That's what we'll discuss today. I said, definitely gonna be bull market action. You promised bull market action. Bull market action we've had, the indices are far higher now. Funny you referenced 1987. That was a very good year for you than in the background people and say, you're the mutual fund manager of the year. Quite an accomplishment. Milton, what were the buy signals you saw in the market? How have they evolved into January and now February, 2026? And what have you made of the recent market action? Are you seeing any sell signals? Okay, I'm gonna get back to what our projections are. Now we don't trade based on projections. We trade based on turning points. April was a major turning point for the market and we pounded the table. We don't always pound the table. We pounded the table, buy, buy, buy. And I'll tell you exactly why. Now this chart was the first of 88 buy signals we received. We received this buy signal April 4th of 2025. I say it's the first of 88 because our retail newsletter only gets the first signal. And we say, you buy now when you hold till we tell you to sell. Institutions are constantly comforted. They give more confirmations and they see many, many of the signals we get. But this was the first signal we saw on April 4th. It was the day before the low. On that day, the NASDAQ's five-day volume was at a 200-day high. On that day, NASDAQ had declined 7% over the last three days. And the VXN, which is the VIX on the NASDAQ, 100, rather than the VIX on the S&P 500, gained 10% for two days in a row. And this is a very rare occurrence. We're looking for rare occurrences. In other words, we're not looking at moving averages and looking at what the Fed is doing or what the Fed is saying in the money supply. We're looking for rare occurrences that take place at market turning points. And on this day, April 4th, you had these three rare occurrences, which I just mentioned. This actually occurred in the past. It occurred in October 8th, 1998, August 5th, 2024, and August 24th, 2015. And the gains, the maximum gains within a year of those signals was 47%, 15.6%, and 23.2%. So far, so far, the April 4th signal through the high on January, through the closing high on January 27th of this year, it's gained 37.53%. So it's outperformed two of the historical precedents. It's underperformed one of the precedents of 47%. However, we're measuring one year out. We're looking at the maximum gains within one year. For all I know, we'll be up 47% by April 4th of 2026. So this was the first signal we got. However, I want to talk about projections. Why did we project to our clients? Now, again, we don't trade based on projections, but projections are very important. Important because if you get a buy signal, it would only, and historically, the median gain after that buy signal was 5%, it really doesn't pay to trade it because, you know, just with the slippage and with the, it just doesn't pay. So we look at the historical returns based on the signal and tell you what the market would do if we followed the historical returns. And it's very helpful for us. So what we did is, for this chart for you guys, I actually created this for you. We took, we broke up our signals by day. So on April 4th, we actually had two signals. I showed you one of them. And based on the signals we had on April 4th, the median maximum gain before the market declined 10%. In other words, how far did the market gain before it declined the next 10%? So the median was 67.57 relative, we're using percentage gains relative to where we started off on April 4th. And the projection on average would be 71.52. Our maximized date on the closing basis was 69.7860. So based on this alone, there's more to the upside, you see, before the market sees a 10% correction. That was April 4th. On April 7th, we had a number of signals as well. And that projected to either 72.91 or 77.51. Again, the market could go much, much higher based on those projections. On April 8th, we had more signals with many more historical backups to the signal, many more historical precedents. And that projected to be between 71.28 as a median, 67.28 as an average. And we've actually exceeded that by closing at the level we closed that was 69.7860. We've exceeded the average of previous returns. April 9th, we had many, many signals. I think we had about 40 signals on April 9th itself. We had many, many historical precedents for these signals. Each of these instances, it's a historical signal, is an actual historical date of the signal. So what signal April 9th signal looks like 30 or 40 times in the past. And these 57 signals generate April 9th, project to between 74.87 or 79.21 before the next decline of 10%. They were only at 69.7860. Now, again, I don't trade based on projections. I just give the clients, this is institutional work. The retailers will not see this kind of work. We tell them how far the market would go if it just gains the median gain or just gains the average gain based on the previous signals. This is April 9th. This is April 10th. I won't go through each one, April 11th. Summary, looking at all the signals from April 4th through April 30th, many, many buy signals, as I said. The median projection would be to be 74.37 in the S&P. The average projection is 75.99, which means from the closing high on January 28th, 27th, it's about nearly 6% and about 8.5% from where we were closed. The actual is 69.78, you see. So again, based on the kind of buy signals we saw in April, the market has not satisfied its historical gains. It has not satisfied its historical mean or average. It hasn't satisfied its historical returns, as you'd expect after that kind of low. I just point out that the low in April generate the most extreme oversold condition we've ever seen. This is based on a combination of 18 oversold indicators, and the indicators go back only to 1995 or so. So maybe you saw it prior to that, but in any event, from 1995 to 2025, we had the most oversold. And the reason is why. Half the country hates Trump. Half the country thinks Trump's gonna cause a Great Depression. And the other half of the country that loves Trump hates Powell. So they think Powell is going to cause a Great Depression or hyperinflation. And when Trump announced tariffs and he great negotiated, people thought, rather than people laughing at him or laughing about it, they took it seriously, and they thought they were gonna have 100% or 200% or 300% tariffs on China, whatever Trump decided on that particular day. And people truly panicked, and market bottoms always occur on panic. So our signals flashed on the days, you know, April 4th into the low, April 8th day of the low, and April 9th day after the low. So you signal at the oversold readings into the low and at the thrust off the low. And again, projections look for, say, another 6% above the current high, which is not a lot. No, 6% is not a lot. For an institutional trader who is trading, some people are trading trillions of dollars, but those who are trading even billions of dollars, they're probably gonna start worrying about the market now if the median projection is 6%. But we don't tell our clients to really worry about projections. We worry about a trading point analysis, and we'll see in a minute that actually looked a little bit cautious. We'll get to that in a moment. I just wanna review some, I took from each day just one signal, just to give your reviewers an idea of what we look at, because up until this point, you could say this Milton is just really, he's just sort of like saying he has all he indicated, why should we? I mean, why should you believe there's some robust indicators? I mean, if all we know, he's like all these charlatans on Wall Street who claim they know what the market's going to do, and everybody knows they can't project the market, and everybody knows the market is efficient, so what exactly does he have? So I decided to take one signal for each of those dates in April just to review what we saw on those individual dates. So for example, April 4th, we had two signals. This is just signal one of two signals, and as I said, the Nasdaq's five-day volume was at a 200-day high. The Nasdaq, again, had lost 10.61% over three days. The threshold for the signal is losing 7%, and the VIX traded between 45 and 60, which is a rarity. The VIX, in our case, was 45.31. That generated signal, gave you the buy signals. As you can see, these are the two historical buy signals. This is the great buy signal we had on April 4th, the day before the low. April 7th, 2025, we also had two signals. Now, what do you see in this one? First of all, instead of looking at the Nasdaq volume, we're looking at the New York Stock Exchange total volume, and its total volume was the highest in 370 days, sometime within the past 20 days. Now, what does that mean? It means we're in a regime of high volume. People who know markets know that turning points take place in a regime of high volume. You don't necessarily see the highest volume on the day of the low or the day of the high, but you do see very, very high five-day volume sometime before the low or sometimes before the high, and we use 20 days as a threshold. So, if we saw five-day volume in the New York Stock Exchange, highest in 375 days, which is a year and a half of trading, we saw that within the past 20 days, we know we're in a regime of high volume. Now, that's number one. Number two is, there's an oscillator generated by Ned Davis Research. I put that for this indicator, but we actually have made some minor changes. But in any event, that oscillator is at 10. It runs from 0 to 100. That oscillator was actually at 4.44 on April 7th, 2025. It ranges from 0 to 100, obviously, with major oversold. And the threshold here, if it's 10 or below. The third indicator is, we take the new highs and new lows in the NASDAQ on a five-day basis, and you took the percentage of new highs to new lows. In any event, it was oversold at minus 16%. And this, again, occurred at the lows in 1998, occurred at the lows in 2018, occurred at the March lows in 2020, and occurred on April 7th, 2025 at the lows. That's one signal on April 7th. We already showed you the projections, but as I said, anyone can show projections. We want to show, get under the hood and see exactly what we're signaling. Again, we're not using moving averages, we're not using crossing, we're not using Fed, we're not using seasonality, we're not talking about, you know, if the market's up the first five days of January, we'll have a bull market. We're talking about precise rarities that occur at market turning points. Let's see what happened on April 8th. April 8th hit four signals. This is one of the four signals. Nasdaq's five-day rate of change was weakest in 1,260 days. You know what that means? That's in five years. The five-day loss in the Nasdaq was the greatest in over a five-year period. Of course, everyone would agree that's a rarity. You don't see that every day. In this case, it was down 12.50% over the five-day period into April 8th. Then, additionally, the S&P 500 four-day advanced decline ratio generated what we call a reverse thrust. Reverse thrust means instead of being 2 to 1 or 7 to 1 a day like today, let's see where it is today. Today, it's about 3 to 1, right? There, it's 0.2 to 1. In other words, so you were overwhelmed, the four-day AD line was overwhelming on the downside and it was below. Meaning that the amount of stocks that were declining as opposed to advancing was overwhelming. Overwhelming to the downside, but extremely overwhelming, extremely, extremely overwhelming. We're not looking at averages. Okay, let's continue. Then, April 9th. April 9th, as I said, we had 50 signals or so. We really have more, but my mind and my computer can't handle much more. Let's see what we had on April 9th. April 9th, the market was up 9%. The S&P was up 9.52% on the day. The NASDAQ was up more than 9%. You had an overwhelming 95.4 upside-downside volume, but this indicator is showing you something else. The S&P was below its two-day moving average, meaning that the S&P was, by definition, by some people's definition, it was in a bear market. That's the first criteria. That's really nothing. Secondly, the market gained at least 6% from its last time it declined 10%. In other words, it happened to have declined 18% into the previous day's low, and this day was up 9.52%. So, by definition, it gained 6% from its last 10% decline, but just to be precise, it's not enough to gain 6%. This has to be the highest high off that low. So, in other words, the S&P had lost 10%. It's now up 6% off that low, but today is the highest high off that low. That again reduces the number of days because in any bull market, the S&P is up 6% from its last 10% decline, but it's not enough to have 6% from its last 10% decline. This has to be the exact high day since the 10% decline. Next one is the S&P generates greatest gain in the last 250 days, which is roughly a trading year. It was up 9.52%. It's the greatest one day gain, and on top of that, the S&P's volume on the day had to have increased by at least 20% over the previous day. In this case, it increased 38.28% over the previous day, and the second condition is it has to be an up day. So, very often when the market crashes, the market is down on the day and the volume increases by 20%. This indicates it needs the market to be up on the day and volume to have increased by 20%. So, all these four things come together. You saw bottoms in 1976, you saw bottoms in 1982, you saw bottoms in 1984, you saw a double bottom in June and in October 2022. Jack, if you recall, we met then, we had a discussion then, and I pointed out that Russell actually bottomed in June, and the S&P bottomed in October, and NASDAQ bottomed in December, so both of these calls were correct. We had a buy signal at the bottom in June and a buy signal at the bottom in October. The June signal actually was the bottom of the Russell, never made a lower low, and the S&P made a low about 2% below the low of June, and we got a buy signal then in October, and again, you had a buy signal October 9th, 2025, this is one of 57 buy signals, just one. Again, my point is to show the robustness of the signal. Also, I don't want to show off too much, but no one on Wall Street has this kind of information. We're really the only one. This particular model that we have, I just finished, I mean, institutions have been writing letters and working with institutions for quite a number of years, but I've been on the side, basically, I've been working on creating these models, and I just finished in September, so a lot of things you see now was really relatively new. I wasn't able to show it to clients a year ago or two years ago or three years ago, because we didn't really finish creating the models and fine-tuning the models and eliminating models that didn't have perfect records until September. So, April 10th, 2025, and again, when you show the top of it, it's the first time this ever signaled. So, the first one, for example, April 4th, the first time it ever signaled was October 8th, 1998, you see? The one on April 7th, the first time it ever signaled was September 1st, 1998. The April 8th signal, the first time this particular indicator ever signaled was March 27th, 1980, and the first time, April 9th, was on April 14th, 1978, and then we have another signal on April 10th, 2025, and that signal is the day of the crash law in 1987. So, what is the model? What is the signal? Basically, the seven-day volume breadth, no polarity. The model doesn't care whether the volume was up or the volume was down. All it cares about, then, on a seven-day basis, you have 12 times as much either upside volume or downside volume as the other side. In other words, either 12 times as much upside versus downside, or 12 times as much downside versus upside. The model doesn't care which extreme it is. All the model cares about is that it's at an extreme, and this particular instance, by April 10th, the seven-day volume breadth was 12 to 1 on the upside in the U.S. Stock Exchange. The seven-day volume breadth in the Russell 2000 was 10 to 1, and the 10-day volume breadth in the Russell 2000 was 8 to 1, and on top of that, the new U.S. Stock Exchange volume on a five-day average was the greatest over the last three years. These four rarities put together have signaled 17 times in the past, as you can see, in each instance a bull market followed, and that's why we're able to pound the table and say a bull market will follow. Thank you, Milton. So it's fair to say you were able to spot in April at the low, a few days within the low, overwhelming signals of the market bottoming that turned out to be correct. And what's interesting to me is we're already close to a year out, and the S&P has up 38%, maybe 40% from there, and your signals from April are so strongly bullish that you want more. You're saying 5%, 6%. This is very interesting. First of all, we haven't had a 7% correction since the April lows. We had a 5% correction within three days of the low, but you never had a 7% correction. Forget about 10%. More than that, it's good you mentioned it. An analogy that came up in a previous interview was, you know, who's a great baseball player? I mentioned Ted Williams or Babe Ruth, but nowadays there's a guy, Otani, right? Yeah. He leaves the bat and hits a homerun. Based on physics, the physics knows that the ball will cross over, will be a homerun over the fence as soon as it leaves the bat, right? There's nothing going on after it leaves the bat that's keeping the ball up and telling it to cross over the fence. It's the momentum of the action and the physics that took place when the bat hit the ball that tells you at that time that it's going over the fence. It was a launch. It was the launch, a force in space. Launch, right. That's what we're looking for on a bi-signal, are launches. So the fact that the market was able to have a 95 to 1 upside volume day one day after the low and other things we look at, that tells you there is underlying... physics, underlying momentum, underlying strength, that doesn't dissipate in five days or 10 days or 20 days. And generally, it lasts a year or longer. I've got to ask you. So it was a very strong thrust from the bottom on April 8th, around there, until the very late October, October 29th, 2025. Since then, it feels the market's been feeling very bullish, but we're kind of in a holding pattern. I'm sure you're going to reference by indicators, buy signals and sell signals from April 2025 all the way throughout the fall and winter. But just if possible, could I bring you back to the current moment right now? It's worse than you say, because we got signals in April, we got signals, some signals in May, no signals in June, no signals in July, one signal in August, which is really not part of the model. I don't really trust that signal. So there's no really confirming signals throughout the bull market. All we have is what you had in April and May. It's all we have going for us. And yes, as you saw, the market really isn't doing as well as you'd expect based on the signals. Right? We showed you really underperforming. We should be up another 4 or 6, 8%, but maybe we still may get there by the time the year is up. Have you got any sell signals recently? First of all, we wrote a report today. I think we should first start with what I talked today and what we wrote about the last week or so. Okay? Yep. So the report is right here. Strangely, the market is strangely oversold, not ready to go back pretty short. In other words, the reason to believe, even though we're aware the market has to be only declined 2.58% over January 27th, all-time high, and even though the NASDAQ has only declined 5.92% from October 29th high to yesterday's close, and the Russell only declined 5.19%, so certainly no major bear market, really just a minor correction, still VIX, VXN has gained 10% for two days running, VXN has gained 35% over three days, NASDAQ has generated its weakest five days in 180 days, and five-day volume in most indexes, most of them, both the small caps and the large caps, are at 180 to 200-day highs. Now, what does that mean? I'm going to show you something here. There's only one time in history that you saw what you saw yesterday, which is the NASDAQ index generating its weakest five-day gain, or actually five-day loss, weakest five-day gain in 180 days, the S&P, the NASDAQ AD line declining 8 out of 10 days in a row, and with 8 out of 10 days, you have a declining AD line, and the VXN gaining 35% over three days. These are three rare indicators to see, and for them to happen in one day only happened once, and guess when that happened? It happened with a sharp, short correction in 1997, right here, see? Now, what have we had now? We had a sharp, short correction. The Russell peaked in late January, it's still early February, the mid-caps peaked in January, the SOX index, the Semiconductor peaked, I think, on January 30th, or maybe, you know, so they just peaked two or three, four days ago, a sharp, short correction, which caused the NASDAQ to have its weakest five-day gain in 180 days, and 8 out of 10 days, a declining AD line, and for the VXN, which is VIX on the NASDAQ, to gain 35% in three days, and when did it ever happen? Once before, not during a bear market, during a minor correction, took 14 days, this correction, you see? That happened again yesterday. So that's the reason, in that particular instance, the market gained 35% without a pullback. It gained a full 39% without a pullback, you see? Today, we're having a very big day, we're having the biggest day since May in the markets, right? Today, we're going Friday, February 6th, extremely strong, strong market. Right. I mean, today, you look at the SOX index, which looked like it's breaking down, SOX is, at this moment, at 5.59%. Okay, anyway, there's one reason to consider covering shorts. Let me continue with this report. There's another reason to consider covering shorts, because VXN gained 10% for two days. I'm sorry, I guess I got to go back. First of all, why have you been short in your model portfolio? I want to get back, it's important that I say what we saw today, and I'm going to get back to exactly why we're short. All right, all right. It's actually in this report. First, our clients, if they're following what I'm saying in the short, I, myself, am short, right? The problem is, you see, actually, yesterday, that suggests to cover the shorts. We're going to see exactly why we're short and whether the evidence we see today is sufficient to cover the shorts. Based on what I just showed you, only had one precedence, in a sharp, unexpected decline that lasts just a number of days, I mean, you saw these indicators, which exactly happened yesterday. In that case, the market, that was its bottom, and it gained 35% before its next high. And the second thing we saw was this, where the VXN gained 10% for two days running, VXN gave 35% in three days, and as the next five-day decline, was the greatest in 180 days. This happened eight times in the past, and let's just show you the instances. 1998, it was at a market low, S&P gained 38%, happened twice in the, 2010 was during the flush crash. In this case, the market went down another 7.9%, so, see, it's not a perfect indicator. October 13th, 2014, the market gained another 13%, bottom two days later, down only three quarters of a percent, gained 13%. August 21st, 2015, was the day before the low, in that instance, the market gained 7% in the 51 days, and the next day, which is another buy signal, it gained 11% in 50 days. And then you have August 5th, 2024, after a sharp correction in the S&P, the market bottomed on that day and gained 18.468. And it signaled on August 4th, 2025 as well. This is not part of a model, these are the kind of things we study each day. Models are fixed. When they signal, we know they signal. Every day I look at our indicators and see what it's telling us, this is one of the things it's telling us. So basically, I'm telling myself it's quite possible that what we saw yesterday was a low. I want to see some more confirmation. Maybe it's not a low, maybe it's going to be more like the flush crash, in this case, right, where the market went down another 7.9%. We've never seen this action early in a bull market, a bear market, let's put it that way. We've seen it during corrective periods and the market bottoms one or two months later, at the worst. We've never seen this kind of action early in a bull market. So that's very promising, Milton, that the action that we saw yesterday on Thursday, February 5th, you often, you have seen in multiple local bottoms, suggesting that it's a bullish indicator. It's not enough for me to cover my shorts. But when I realized that the S&P was down less than 3%, Nasdaq was down less than 6% off its highs. And still, you saw panic in my indicators, these rare indicators. That suggests that we're all going to be fooled, and the market could take off. But I haven't triggered this yet. And I realized my retail newsletter clients are still long, because they had no reason to get out. They're not traders. They're long-term investors. We'll get to that in a moment. And they're sitting pretty today. My institutional investors are not, because they maybe short gold, maybe short stocks, maybe short the Nasdaq, maybe short the Russell, maybe short the S&P, and they're all screaming today. But this is why we went short. This is the reason we went short, right here. OK? Yep. I'm going to show this later on. We got a sell signal on December 11th. See, December 11th, 2025, we got a sell signal. This sell signal does not always work. OK? In other words, this sell signal is telling you that the VX, I don't want to give you the secret sauce, but it's looking at a short-term rate of change in the VXN, which is the VIX on the Nasdaq, relative to another short-term VXN, which is longer than the first shorter term. So you're going to see a sharp shift in the VXN on a short-term basis, relative to previous short-term basis. If I had to give you a number, I'd say five days relative to 30 days. I'd tell you 10 days relative to 30 days. Those aren't the real numbers. Anyway, these give- I'm sorry, Milton, is it an increase in the Nasdaq mix or a decrease? It's an increase on a very short-term, rather over previous short-term. OK. You can tell me after the call, Milton. But for now, yeah. OK. Yes, I guess I could. But listen, so in this case, this catches bear market rallies. In other words, when the market's up 18% or 15% in a bear market, it catches rallies. It catches major bull market peaks. But during an extended bull market, which you may be having now, it gives a number of false signals. I've pulled out the successful signals from 1998, and what we're tracking is the market's following what it does when the signals are successful. If it's not, we get out of the short. You understand? We're going short on a probabilistic basis, knowing you may be wrong. So let me show you what we did. You know how much your market has gained since December 11th? If you were to look at this table, what's the maximum gain since December 11th? Everybody's talking about the great new year and the bull movement, right? OK, I'll guess- I'll guess- I'll guess 7%. What the market's S&P gained a maximum of 1.12% since December 11th. That's all. Really? Wow. I can show you the chart if you'd like. OK. If there's anyone I believe, Milton, it's you. From December 11th close to January 27th close, which was the final all-time high in the S&P, it's only gained 1.12%. Now, when the successes were successful, you saw instances where it gained 1.98, 5.17%, 2.61, 2.72. So right now, the way the market has acted off those highs is very consistent with successful signals. Got it? Uh-huh. OK. It hasn't really moved. Now, secondly, let's see. We're now 37 days past the signal. At yesterday's close, we were 37 days past the signal. How has the S&P done? Now, S&P hasn't collapsed. It's only down 1.49% since December 11th. But let me show you something. In the year 2000, the signal on June 12th, the market was up 0.45% 37 days later, yet it had a total decline off the signal of 23.70%. In 2001- It was just later. It was just later. 58 days later. Right. Right.  But the point is the market held up just as it's held up now Or actually or it's held then as well. Secondly In here it was up 0.31 percent in 2001 But from the date of the signal the ultimate decline was 32 percent and then again in in um in 2015 Excuse me. Yeah, it was up 1.07 percent by day 37, but it's ultimately 13 percent and again in 2021 It was up 0.36 percent Through day 37 and it's ultimately 21 percent. So therefore I told my clients. Yes, we're short since december 11th Yes, the market hasn't gone down. However, the market hasn't gone up. It's only gone up 1.2 12 maximum and Looking at the instances in the past where the signal work By day 37 in many instances was up. We're down 1.49 So the my recommendation to the to the institutions now, they don't all follow me They just use me as an input. Obviously the people managing billions and trillions of dollars. I'm just one input Hopefully i'll be one of the satisfied one of the best inputs, but i'm just one input but in any event Based on this successful short signal. We should still be short now It might change at today's close for all I know right but based on this successful short signals in the past Let's face it. We only have 1.12 percent to december 11th in the smp And at yesterday's close we were down 1.49, which is totally consistent with previous successful signals This is the one reason I went short nothing to do with the fed nothing to do with trump. Nothing with moving averages Simple and indicated doesn't have a perfect record But it works great at calling market peaks and boom and bear market rally peaks And since we had no new bicycles since since since may and we had one bicycle in june, which is i'll get to it Maybe later with a weak Bicycle, we're giving you the benefit of the doubt to the short side However, I would tell you a retail investor who's following my work Would sit through a correction of four five six, even seven percent and not get out and and and because we're very long-term oriented for Institutions, we're training oriented. We can go short. We can go long. We can leverage It's a totally different ball game And this is the reason we got short just because of this one single Of course in the back of my mind. I know there's there's a recession indicator 100 record that's now in a cell which is the rate of change of the unemployment rate. That's suggesting recession I know the leading indicators are still suggesting recession and maybe there'll be recession Maybe depression may be great deflation may all be inflation. We don't really care. We just care about the Indicators and in the back of my mind I know if you're going to get a major bear market would be some sort of event that we probably can't even predict that's going to be associated with that bear market, I think I already asked you this milton, but It was the move in the v the nasdaq vix vxn was it a decline or an increase It has to be for you. It's actually a decline It signals that after rally. It's actually a decline. I'm sorry. It's a sharp decline Let's say it's five days, but it's not five days. Let's say it's five days relative to 30 days relative to 20 days It's not 50 30. It's not 20. You want to see a sharp Decline in vix relative to the rate of change for a longer period and it's basically It's inclusive the five days include the 30 days. You see it's not five days in the previous 25 days It's five days and 30 days including these five days, which has to be a greater extreme I see so so it's people it's uh investors who were hedged as bidding up options They got rid of their hedges too quickly Very they're very optimistic of the market on a very short-term basis showing up in these numbers, right? Exactly it's a shift in expected volatility, which is a shift in bullishness which doesn't always show up in the doesn't always show up in the institutional, uh In the in the uh retail newsletter of followers doesn't always show up necessary and put call ratios But it shows up in this indicator precisely near near market peaks Yes, almost never and was it two coincidence things this vxn thing happening and something else or was just this? No, no, this is one indicator based on vxn itself one indicator. They say it's not Doesn't have a perfect record. Yeah This is special because you know Most of the times people see implied volatility falling or even crashing and they see that as a giant buying opportunity For you, it makes you nervous. That's very interesting. No, no, no, no context context context jack If this would have if this would have signaled On june 15th, I would it didn't but if it did I would have ignored it Because you're just coming right off a major low with major buy signals Mm-hmm Since it's signaling in december after the market's been up since april and since um, I got no additional confirming buy signals That's when I will try to act on this in other words When I tell you the signal is not always perfect and I mentioned that in bull markets you're going to get false signals I'm aware of that. I'm not going to during the bull market. I'm not going to have four false signals I'm going to follow I'm going to follow signals in which the market has already gained significantly and there's no confirming buy signals that makes sense and So to me, you're normal normally milton you get an overwhelming uh Constellation, it's like a it's like a parade of buy signals or sell signals that that motivate you Just let me finish that motivate you to to establish a position It's interesting me milton and you know, maybe maybe you know, I won't without your permission disclose Just exactly how short you are in your model portfolio, but I can tell our audience, uh, very very very short It's interesting to me that it indicates Why why you have such a large short position given this one reading, uh, yeah Well, there's more there's other things that I talk about, but we went short in december 11th We added short subsequently based on other things. I just want to show you okay We're long into december 11th. We're short on december 11 I'm trying to show you why really but I want to tell you one other thing and I don't know most technicians won't admit to this Many will but many won't It is so much easier to call a market bottom technically than to call the market peak Okay, yet yet Technicians are always afraid to call the market bottom and they're never afraid to call the market peak That's why they're so wrong at the top. Yeah, they're so wrong at the bottom It's so amazing. In other words, it's easier to call bottoms, but everyone's always afraid to call the bottom But it's so much easier technically Calling the top is very very difficult for everybody because top is in stocks not necessarily commodities Clients are easy, but stocks are have rounded tops and there's always groups that are doing well One of the markets peaking so stocks are much more difficult And it's funny enough everyone's out there, you know You see people you interview all calling for market crashes market crashes market crashes Calling it for six months eight months nine minutes ten years in a row. You understand Somehow they find it easy to call for market crashes They're very difficult market bottoms, even though market bottoms are so much easier to call and market tops are much more difficult to call Sophisticated investors don't typically park their cash in high yield savings accounts instead when they want yield They turn to one of the fastest growing asset classes for institutional investors private credit These private credit strategies were once reserved exclusively for wealthy institutional investors But now they're available to investors of all sizes Thanks to the fundrise income fund which has more than 600 million invested and a 7.97 percent distribution rate With most traditional savings yields falling It's no wonder why sophisticated institutional and individual investors are turning to higher yielding asset classes like private credit Click the link in the description or visit fundraise.com slash mm to invest in the fundraise income fund in just minutes The fund's total return in 2025 was 8 and the average annual total return since inception is 7.8 Past performance does not guarantee future results current distribution rate as of 12 31 2025 Carefully consider the investment material before investing including objectives risks charges and expenses This and other information can be found in the income funds perspectives at fundraise.com income. This is a paid advertisement back to the interview Okay You want to talk to bitcoin a little more about stocks I could talk about because I have a lot more about stocks Let's tease the people a little bit. Let's uh, let's let them wait. Let's talk more about stocks We will get into bitcoin. We will get into gold. We will get into silver. But yeah, what were the other signals you saw? We actually let me do this control if you can't see the screen, let me know I will Russell 2000 we call this I actually sent out the email That's 401. I started writing it at 10 minutes to 4 on january 23rd day after the top That's a close This is a russell 2000. This is a chart. You can see where i'm circling here this circle Yes, you see this island reversal. I'm reversal means it gapped into the into the update and and a gap down You can make a little island This this bar on the top is an island. You see you see what I mean by island Can you explain what what this means and and what it indicates in? What it means when the market gaps to the up now Some people don't understand what a gap is a gap doesn't mean the market opened higher than yesterday's close. That's not a gap The gap means it happened Opened higher than yesterday's high and the downside gap means it opened lower than yesterday's low and for gappy valid It has to trade the whole day With the gap not being filled. So in other words If yes, if the market is up on a day and it it opens higher than the day's previous high and by the end of the day, it remained higher than It always remained higher than the day's previous high. That's an upside gap The downside gap is just the opposite the market opens below the previous day's low And throughout the day it remained its highest high of the day was below the previous day's previous low. Okay, that's a gap A gap basically is telling you There's an emotional move. That's what a gap is supposed to tell you. It's an emotional move in the market It's very very rare In some markets more rare than other markets, but it's very rare to see a market gap at all I'll show you some markets that almost never gap But there's something called an island reversal, which is just Two gaps one gap that takes place on the way up another gap that takes you on the way down And you could make an island. There's an air pocket between between those two gaps now I I showed you this one, but this is a unique app. The only time it ever happened in history the russell 2000 What does that mean? It's a one-day island. I call it an isolated one-day island reversal at the top the russell 2000 Was really really very very lethargic for quite a number of years as you know, right? all of a sudden in Anyway, people are saying the market is broadening. The market is broadening. Wow, look, the small caps are moving, right? Everyone was saying it. Even the bears were saying it. Oh, you know, the AI is gonna go down, but the Russell is gonna continue higher. There's a shift in rotation, right? And people believed it so much to an extent that on January 22nd, the day of the final high so far in the Russell, the market gapped up. But that's only half the story. The next day, the market gapped down and it created a one-day island reversal, one day. And this never happened before, ever? Never in the Russell 2000. Usually an island reversal has three days or six days. I'll show you the history. I went through every island reversal in the history of the Russell, got it? So I'm not just talking out of my hat. I know you're not talking out of your hat yet. Russell 2000 is the US small caps. Russell 2000 had an island reversal. I immediately said the Russell 2000 is giving a very, very bearish signal. So we had the sell signal on December 11th in the S&P. S&P only was up maximum 1.12% above its high in the... Actually, by January 22nd, it wasn't even up 1.12% because it picked on January 27th. But anyway, this is another reason to suggest the market might be topping. And in fact, the Russell 2000, ultimately through yesterday's close, we're down, I think, 7% of its high. What am I showing you? This is an island reversal gap is negative. I looked at previous tops that occurred with an island. Now you see, you have a gap up right off the lows in April. You see, you have a gap up in May. You have a gap up in June. You ignore these gaps because the market's coming off a thrust low. You don't... Just like we don't look at the... You don't look at the VXN sell signal right off the low because of course, VXN is gonna collapse right off the low. So too, there'll be a lot of enthusiasm when the market is coming off a low. But we're looking at this, where everyone's so excited about the Russell, claiming that it's starting to break out, claiming you see a broadening. And that's where you see an island reversal. Gaps up, gaps down, and then it continues lower. Now, we wrote our report the day it gapped down. Of course, it continued lower until yesterday's close. So this is showing early in the move, you see multiple gaps, which are considered buy signals. See, context is the key in many indicators. Gaps are not random. Gaps take place off lows and gaps take place into tops. You have to know where you are, where you potentially are. This is July 17th, 2000. This, again, it wasn't an island reversal. It was two gap days in a row off the high, two gap downs. And that marked the top of the market. The market tested, never made a higher high. And then it declined some 40% over the next two years from July 17th, 2000 to the bottom of the bear market. You saw over here again in September 19th, 2008. Now, realize- Lehman. There was a financial crisis. And for some reason on that day, there was some positive news out of the Fed. And the Russell 2000 gained 19.85% on the day. Milton, only because I'm a giant nerd and I've read a lot of books about 2008, I think that was, you're a technician, not that you think it doesn't matter. I lived through it, but I sort of, I remember what the market did, but I forget what the news was. There was a stimulus bill that was, I think was going to go through Congress and then it didn't pass. And it was a- Okay. So it was up 19% into the day, 95%, gapped up to the top, and then it declined 60% to its final low. And this is a continuation gap. So I'm pointing out where you see important gaps that previous peaks. Now look at this one. This is on January 17th, 2020. Remember the COVID crisis? I think so, right? COVID crisis? Yep. The COVID crisis didn't really begin until early March, but the Russell knew about the COVID crisis because the Russell gapped up one day before its peak. One day before the all-time high in the Russell 2000, on January 17th, 2020, the Russell gapped up. That was its high. Then it further gaps into the secondary high, but this is, again, a sign of a market peak. Uncalled for enthusiasm at a new high. Got it? Mm-hmm. In that case, the market declined another 43.90% to its low. And I show 2007, a various gap. I don't want to take too much time on this. I just want to justify why I'm able to, I'm going through history of gaps. I mean, the only other, you see, this is our island reversal. This is our current market. You see the one I showed you earlier? January 22nd, 2016, right? Yeah. The peak of November 15th, 2024, the final peak in that rally was also on a gap day. You see? Then the market declined 29.90%. To find an island reversal in the Russell, there are island reversals. Let me see if I, I think I highlighted an island reversal here. No, this is not a true island reversal, no. I think I highlighted one, but I don't take too much time on it now. But the one-day island reversal we had now, which I call it an isolated one-day island reversal at the top, has never before occurred in the Russell. It occurs in commodities often enough. It never occurred in the Russell. And the reason it occurred this time is because everyone's so enthusiastic about the Russell. Rather than understanding, and I wrote this in my reports, rather than understanding that in nearly every bull market in history, it peaks when the laggards start moving. It doesn't peak when the previous movers start moving. It peaks when the laggards start moving and the generals, they call it the generals and the troops. The generals slow down and then they let the troops get killed. You understand? And I'm sorry, are those, are the laggards, would they be high beta, high risk, high speculation stocks, or are they safe stocks like Coca-Cola? Every market has a different laggard, yeah. Sometimes it's a low beta like Coca-Cola, but sometimes it's a small cap like the Russell 2000. In this case, the Russell 2000, the SP 600 is very little for the last four years. And all of a sudden it starts surging into a peak and everyone's claiming bullish, bullish, bullish. Market breadth is increasing and the market is broadening and get out of your AI and just buy the small caps. And I say, no, no, it happens. So typical at the top of a bull market where they call it the dogs, right? The dogs start, there's an expression. Something about the dogs lead the pack, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, these are the dogs. I think 40% of the Russell 2000 have no earnings, you know, a negative earnings. So this is not a quality indicator. You call it small cap, whatever. They're great small caps and they're garbage small caps. The Russell 2000, about 40% of it are small caps that have really no earnings. I just wanted to point out what we saw, which is this amazing, one day, it's another reason to be bearish. Again, there's another reason back in May why I'm not, I didn't use yesterday's action to cover my shorts, even though there's some historical instances. My models didn't go long. I just gave instances where it might be a bottom. I'm still, you know, tops are very difficult to call, bottoms are difficult to call. And this bottom after 2.5% decline in the S&P, less than 3%, you know, it's highly unlikely that it's a bottom. Maybe it would be a sharp, short correction that ends. We'll see. I'm trying to tell you that I'm not pounding the table. I'm not sure. I'm trying to show you what we tell our clients. We don't every day have a strong opinion like most people try to do. My strong opinion is that we're in a bull market again in April and the market should continue higher. It's projected to go higher unless you see something different. We haven't seen anything major different except the VXN sales signal in December and these things like, for example, this gap up in the Russell 2000. Let's see, let's get, let's, let's, let me show you the last buy signal we ever got, if that's interesting to you. Absolutely. I said the last signal we got was on August 13th. But you said you didn't like it. I don't like it. I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. This signal occurs when the Russell declines by at least 5%. Bottom eight days ago, meaning it didn't make a lower low for eight days. So on August, on August, its first signal on April 9th, 2009, but the latest signal was August 13th, 2025. In that case, the Russell was down like five and a half percent. SP is down like less than 2%. The rest of the market didn't pull back. The Russell pulled back, held its low for eight days. And on the eighth day, it exhibited an upside gap. Remember we said upside gaps come, are great after a low and the bearish, when the aftermarket has extended rally. This is one of the cases where you get an upside gap, just eight days after a low. Now the low was only 5%. In most of these instances, it wasn't just the Russell down 5%. Many other indices were down. In this case, A, only the Russell was down 5%. Even the SP600 small cap wasn't down 5%. And on the day A, the gap to the upside. Let me just show you the history of this one. This is a signal on April 9th, 2009, right after a major bear market down. It was a 56% bear market. It was like, right? The signal on October 14th, 2000, most early in a bull market. It's still on September 3rd, 2010, after 19% decline in the S&P. The signal on 2012. This is more of a, after a rally, but you did have a great low in 2011 at the lows. It signaled, here it signaled during an up move in 2017. Here it signaled after 220 lows at the June correction. And now it's signaled here. Now when I saw the signal, I really, I think it's a weak signal, but basically the S&P, the S&P is up 7.9% since then, which is not a bad move. Why do I say it's not a bad move? It's only up 7.9% since August 13th. When I look at the history of the other successful moves, you see right here, there's a table. This shows all those nine instances where we got the same signal. The 90, I'm showing the 90. You're looking at the results for the S&P, even though the signal is for the Russell. Yes, yes, yes. I showed my clients the signals for the Russell, but I trade, basically the miles are built to call the S&P. Okay, that's the point. But the point over here is, is that through 90 days, the maximum gain was 6.72, which seems pretty weak, right? However, in 2016, the maximum gain through 90 is only 2.83% and went on to gain 15%. You see, in 2012, by day 90 through 90 days, it was only a 5.38%. And yet again, the total 22% within a year. In 2009, it was up 5.33% through day 90 and ended up on 11.47. So the fact that we're only up 6.72%, it's not really troubling. But this doesn't go into my models. It's not robust enough as far as I'm concerned. So I say, I built models to call markets, which we'll talk about for retail and so on. This doesn't go into my model. This is something that I show my clients. Show what's going on in the market. I did not put much weight into this particular single But we're on a buy signal off the lows anyway, but I didn't put much weight into the signal because it You're looking for a gap a gap up after decline and only the Russell decline There's only a minor decline of 5% and in Russell 5 to the client is really just a hiccup It's just a random event Russell is far more volatile than the S&P. So that's that one. Okay, now there's something else here This is very important. Mm-hmm This is very important because you would think that I just show some signals with some data You think I wouldn't even follow the standard technical stuff, but I actually believe in I actually follow standards in this technical stuff as well I know Milton I was looking at some of the data and all the materials you said almost all the time you have very few charts all Tables and data, but this time I said Milton making charts what's going on? These charts are just reflecting where the data is. But here this is let me show you this We looked at every great market peak since 1966. Okay, every market top in the S&P We're looking for minimum decline of 18% in the S&P. So for example 1966 market peaked on February 9th and the client 22% since in 1981 the the S&P peaked on They're actually looking to doubt peaked in April 27th client 24% Natalie the peaked at April May 29th client 28% and so on 87 SB peaked in August 25th declined 33% you see we're looking for every decline of at least 80% 2000 the S&P peaked on March 24th down 49% nothing peaked on March 10th down 77 so on so forth Aren't just highs. They're highs that specifically were the peak final highs in the market final highs not just highs The final highs the mark for the client of 18% final final highs Okay, because most of the time sorry, but most of the time highs are actually bullish, right Well until it's bearish Until a bearish, right, but yeah, because the market makes a series of higher highs So it's final high and we can market to make market make 50 higher. I still it's finalized So yes, if you look at it that way, of course highs are generally bullish. It's a question What takes place at the highest for example, I'll give you I highly with little red arrows There are four pages by the way kept data. Yeah, like the 10-day 10-day trend now I hate to explain what trend is because it's even I've always found it difficult to understand it Now I find I prepared I looked it up before its ratio of upside volume to ratio of downside volume. No The ratio of the ratio of upside down to downside line to the ratio of upside stocks to downside stocks It's a ratio of a ratio. In other words, it's not enough to have high upside volume You have to high upset volume relative to the number of stocks that went up So for example, if you have ten to one upside volume and you have ten times as many stocks up is down The trend will be one neutral however, if you had ten times to one upside volume and only At a one-to-one ratio of up stocks to down stocks. You see then the truth will be point fifty That'll be a very very low ratio Because the upside volume is overwhelming to such an extent that it takes the ratio ratio down but any event I don't get into the train because I have to get into everything and it's gonna take too long, but The 10-day trend in the S&P Nasdaq at the day of the peak of January 27th of the S&P was 0.76 Now this exactly the meeting you see it at previous market peaks It's 0.78 you see right at what you normally see at a market now I'm sure all four pages are all yellow when they're not when the red when any column is read to me It's not consistent with what you see the previous market previous market peak. Everything is consistent But many of them aren't the medians for example 25 the New York Stock Exchange train at point 98 the medians 0.96. You see Let's look at this one 10 day advanced declines in the Nasdaq the New York Stock Exchange is 1.07 over one The median that major peaks is 1.09 over one. We're at the median What about the number of 52 week highs in the S&P on December? It's January there the 5045 which seems like a high number But in fact the median peak at final market peaks is 47 right there And I can go on and on and on let me find an interesting one Let's look at rates of change because that's really important Let's look at the at the the six-month rate of change in the S&P, you know The SP has only gained nine point two two percent over the last six six months, even though it's up 37 percent since April It's slowed down. The median is ten point zero eight percent at the top. Let's look at the Nasdaq You know, the Nasdaq is only up twelve point four six percent over the last six months Even though it's up 45% off the lows, but the median at a peak is 13 point 19 Let's look at the smaller caps because we're all talking about small caps. The the SP 400 is mid cap It's six months rate of change eight point five percent, but the median is ten point nine four below the median gain It's more it's weaker than you'd expect at the top. You see so these tell me about the rest one and what that means Threshold means if it be above this level of return read It's a six month rate of change in the Nasdaq would be above eighty one point eleven Totally inconsistent with what you see at a market peak. I've never seen that strength in a market peak Well, let's look at the number of highs in the S&P because that actually helped me out in 2020 2023 Let me show you that S&P is page 152 because the threshold is 87 There's a period during 1924 Where most of these things were yellow, but the number of highs were about 92 I think you may have talked to me about that Milton. Yeah Which told me that that's not the market generally You would expect that to be the market peak because you never saw a market peak with that many new highs Okay, just showing you something else we look at you just went through a lot of the data But I didn't hear a lot of conclusions. What what were some of the areas, yeah, yeah, if anyone's telling you if anyone's telling you that the market action is inconsistent with action seen at previous market peaks or if anyone tells you that Federal Reserve action is Inconsistent with what we've seen the previous market peaks or if anyone tells you that the rate of change of interest rates of the long bond Is inconsistent what you've seen it at market peaks I would show them I take technicals at the high and show all of these things are in my They're on my table and all these things are consistent what you've seen at prior market peaks You're saying that you're seeing signs of Mark saying that no one can argue that the market can't peak now based on technical data They can argue that we're not at a peak, but they can't argue that we can't peak in other words sometimes very often that you know, half this date is red meaning the market is showing signs that it's not peaking and Red in this instance is good in the same way red in China means the stock market goes up Yeah, red means that it's not consistent. Yeah with what you see the previous peaks I mean a good example would be the five-day the five-day breath Like for example, let me show let's get the five-day breath five-day advanced declines you see the 1.33 It's above 2.3 2.34. You're not gonna see a market peak. It's gonna be a Thrust only once did you see it above to that's back in? 1976 now 196 just to let you know was one of the strangest markets because the SNP peaked the Dow peaked They declined about 18% at the same time the American Stock Exchange I don't think exists anymore, which was which was a small cap index of the day was in a major bull market gaining 30% It was mainly in oil stocks, but the oil stocks and the S&P were also rallying while ESP was declining So therefore at the peak you saw the at that peak you saw the oil stock surging and you saw 2.3 4 to 1 ad line at the peak, but generally you see at the peak the ad line is It's looking at you never see it even above 1.75. We're 1.33 meeting is 1.18. But let me you had 1.66 2011 top also difficult top But you 1.58 1.52 and 89 to 90. Okay. This is just one example five-day advanced declining We have a five-day deal and we use as a breath rust You know, we have readings of three four five to one over five day basis Which uses by signals but to tell you can't expect the market to peak even at a two to one level You wouldn't expect the market we're not there now If you had 90 new 52 cars in the S&P when you less or the high and this only looks at the days of highs So if January 27th could have been the final high because the data is consistent It doesn't mean that is the final high it means it could be the final high and we're looking at you look at me as You can see we look at many things, you know, we don't just hang your hat on one indicator. Yes. Okay Let's see what else you want you you totally want to talk about many things to talk about So we'll return to stocks and we will I promise our audience just get into the commodities gold silver Maybe a little oil but also particularly Bitcoin but Milton I just want to take a lot of the work that you've been showing is for Institutional clients some of the biggest and most successful hedge funds in the world You recently launched a product that is for individual investors, you know, I include myself in that category What is different about this product? Tell us a little bit about the value that you think it could provide I'm gonna take it step by step But basically before I even show any charts show any data individual investors find it very very difficult because They read the news and they hear the news and they try to find follow financial reports and even listen to great podcasts like Jack follows great podcast. They always get conflicting opinions. They don't know what to decide for themselves They're they're out of the market when the markets rallying they get into the market close to the top You know, it's very difficult for an individual investor And I wanted to create I spent 10 years working on models I really didn't plan to build a newsletter for retail investors I really just to envision wanted to write a book and when I remember as you did my research My research was getting so robust and it fascinated me because I couldn't believe what I was discovering in the market be honest with you I If 10 years ago, I would have told me by the time you finish you can have 2,800 indicators You can have about 600 indicators that have a perfect track record meaning without a pullback on a bicycle with pullbacks of less than three and a half percent You know, I wouldn't believe it's even possible most indicated work on percentage, you know work 65% at a time You're happy it works 75% of time You're ecstatic the indicators that work historically 100% at a time and they're not made-up indicators not backfitted indicators We're just looking for rare data that takes place at lows The problem is most people who look at market lows only see what's obvious to them. They open the chart. They see a movie average There are many many indicators as I mentioned earlier you saw they're not obvious to the most people I even asked most technicians Because they don't follow run it's not computerized just as long as we're talking I have I have one of my One of my spreadsheets open. So here you see for example This might this today's spreadsheet that I get my indicators on. Oh, wow So so for example today, I saw the VXN yesterday VXN was up 10% over two days VXN was 35% in three days These indexes had the highest three-day volume in 200 days 200 days 20 instead. I get these indicators These are not signals. These are just basic indicators, but I want to point out. I'll go to the column We show no signal. You see comes with no signal right here. Yeah, no signal It's going to show you How many indicators we have so you go to nothing? 17,000 19,000 20,000 be this soon will be this soon. You see we have a thousand We make two thousand three line indicators that have not signal today. It's dead. We have twenty three thousand six that did not signal You know, it's like a twenty twenty thousand three hundred and ten that have not signal today, right? Right, so the point is we're looking for these things to signal We're looking for rare signal not looking for the kind of things people look at every day markets up 1% marks of 2% You know, we're looking for things that don't take place too often But when they do take place, they're telling you something got it So sometimes the VXN getting 35% in three days tells you something as I pointed out, but sometimes it's not sufficient That's why we're not ready to cover our shorts today By tomorrow yet today's action may change things, you know, it's a very very big bullish thing. Okay, let's get me out Let's let's go back to to the retail editor. What is it? So I wanted to create something for retail people. I want to create something Well, what I say what to create something I was only able to create it after I did all my work I realized that the data I'm getting Allows me to create something that retail investors never had before and that is you know We were told that if you miss the greatest days of the market, you know, only five days a year Yeah, I yeah, right So if you're gonna try to time the market, it's likely you're gonna miss those great days. You know, why not because By chance, you'll miss those five great days Go so the five good days generally take place early on in a bull market They don't take place middle of a bull market like the 9% gain you had in An April in April 9th was early in a bull market, right? See that? Mostly most often the great gains take place Early in a move you miss get if you don't get it early you wait for the moving averages across you wait till the Fed Eases 15 times you're late and you missed a great move So on the other hand I realized in doing my work that it's difficult to call tops You know, it's as they say the recession indicator called Called 18 of the last six bull markets. In other words Tops are more difficult to call. So this is what I did. It's it's different. We decide we're not going to call market tops at all We're gonna be long the market until it declines For the model purpose I used 8% but for in talking purposes I say 7 or 8% but for the the data you're gonna see is all based on a decline of a minimum of 8% Okay, so we said like this we're gonna buy the first buy signal as generated another institution see our hundreds of signals We keep you know, we're charging our retail people $10 a month institutions pay as much as 12,000 a month So we're not gonna we're not gonna give you the data way but we're going to give the Retail indicators a buy signal at a first at a first signal At a first new bicycle after they're out of the market. So so what gets them out of the market? Say they got a bicycle April 4th. They'd still be long because the market has never declined 8% right? Maximum the client was 5% and change a few days after the loan So we're gonna say you're gonna buy the market hold on and you'll hold on until we get you out We're gonna get you out after about a decline of about 8% which is the model why 8%? very simply An investigator tolerated an 8% decline if he's ready made 30% on the up move number one Secondly, he could tell you 8% decline if the marks gonna decline 44% or 35% or 26% or 19% He's happy to have missed the bulk of the down move, even though he caught the first 8% of the down move. Got it Number one we have we had 50 roughly 55 bicycles since 1957 I'm only showing you the initial buy signal after after we're out of the market I'm not showing institutional wise is thousands of bicycles for the retail model. We have a buy signal We had about 55. It says the 55 buys and sells since 1957 you see and this is a chart showing all the buys Left by I highlighted April 4th 2025 the markets up 38% since then right since April 4th now These are the boys and the based on signals, which I'll show you some of the singles, however One of the cells when do you get out? So you're gonna get we don't know what the cells when that's not enough to call The cells because cells are very difficult tops are difficult to call. We're not gonna anticipate a bear market We're not gonna say get out now at the tie of the market because the bear market say, you know, my my my my clients You know my retail clients, you know My individual investors who don't have time to sit at a computer all day and watch the market They'd rather be retired. They'd rather build a retirement account And work in there in the shops and work in there on the computers or whatever they do and rather than not watch the market we'll tell you to get out when the market down some 8% and Then you'll just go into Treasury bills, which is a great safe investment Okay, and we'll tell you when to get back in when we get a buy signal. And now what is that done? So let's be clear. There is one and only one cell signal the markets down seven or eight percent. That's it For the model purposes what I'm showing you now is based on a two-year model Purposes what I'm showing you now is based on 8% at a closing basis in reality. It's seven to eight percent. Yeah, I I'm not the first one to you 78% William O'Neill as you know in his famous can't slim model Tells you buy a stock and get out with down seven or eight percent So I use that term but the model was built using 8% to be honest Each of these cells you're gonna see we've done it. Let me go. Let's go to the next page because this is good, this is the This is all the buy dates Let's see what you did if you got out Down 8% or something gave me down 10% because the market we got 3% in one day. Yeah, this is the batting averages in other words The model starts on the first buy still occurs on October 21st. 1957 was a day before the low the market gave 51.26 percent before you got out you got out on September 21st 59 and You average the average long through the average long position getting it to get out to gain 26% the average decline when you when you Got out of the losses was one point four one percent a ten thousand dollars invested in 1957 Following this model to be worth one billion one hundred two thousand dollars at the end closer trading yesterday January 6 ten billion. How is that possible? Wait, it compound the eight and a half percent per annum. Try it out 50 70 years of 68 years You started with 10,000 18 a percent per annum starting at 10,000 68 years, you'll see Okay That's it. So the point is though that you're you're not gonna you're a long-term investor in the scp-500 You're not gonna pick stocks. I'm not gonna pick sectors. You're not gonna worry about their markets You're gonna be long gonna capitalize the most of the big moves in the sp500 you're gonna wait till the markets decline down some money before you get out and Be and if you're in a retirement account, you're not gonna pay taxes and this has been the return yet the profitable long trade Yeah, 95% of the long trades have been profitable. Give me an example. You bought an August 4th Let's see the markets down 10% tomorrow. So we're down 8% off the highs. It's a profitable trade You bought you bought an August 4th, you're not gonna be a 40% to be up 29% Got it. Yep and melted So 18.5% that is a pretty good. Yeah Buffett. I think is 20 Around 20% but it certainly outperforms most hedge funds I mean it doesn't have from Stanley Druckenmiller or George Soros, but it's certainly out outperforms 90% of hedge funds Oh, yeah, and Milton the fact that you're never on the when the markets going up You're never outperforming by you having a beta or exposure over 100% So it means it's just it's just avoiding drawdowns and then what that indicates to me I think it must be a logical conclusion Is that the worst periods for the S&P 500 are when it's already down more than 8% from its highs? It's amazing that you have to look at this This is the year-over-year returns based on the model a yellow of the years the SP were down So the year 2000, let's go back here in 62. The SP is not 8% the model gained 18% 66 the SP is down 10% the model was flat in the year in 74 the SP is down 26 miles up 20 Because we're out during the bulk of the decline we get in within days as a low and we catch those big five-day moves that people talk our fate of missing is 81 the marks down 5 0 15 last was 2022 the the market was down 18 for 19 percent. We're up 3.6 percent again. This is total return It's including the dividends on the SP and it's including the the income you get from Treasury bills Now, okay. So this is just showing the yearly returns any question pick a year like, you know You don't get the advanced signals but you you just get this reading of the S&P 500 when to get in when to get out and Your model has been long the S&P Throughout all of this turmoil since early April and I think that is so important because it's not just the quality of The research I mean as people can tell everything you have a pretty encyclopedic read of of the markets and market history null null null null null null to the pattern of Cisco where Cisco was no issue. And I didn't trade it well. I got out early in the move, but I was really one of the first technical analysts. I remember I met with an analyst who was negative. He's a famous bearer. He was negative on Tesla. And he said, it's just an oil company. And I said, Tesla's selling cars without advertising. Not one, this is when Tesla first started. They sell cars with no advertisements. I said, this just tells you something about the underlying demand for electronic cars. That's all I needed to know. They were selling cars, the volume was increasing, but they weren't even advertising. I mean, which car maker doesn't take ads in the Super Bowl, you know, or whatever it is, just to get his name out there and show how great the car is. Tesla didn't need that. So Tesla was a great long-term stock. It's way overvalued. I hadn't bought it. I never owned it in a long portfolio. I don't see any reason to own it now. You see, you still break out of consolidation, but you start with weak earnings and the stock wasn't cheap. So I wouldn't buy this kind of a breakout. There's nothing about the chart of Tesla telling me to buy it. Again, like Bitcoin, you want to own it because it's gone up, but that's not a reason to own a stock. You want to own it because it's gone up with some strong technicals. As I gave an example, when Babe Ruth swings at a ball or when one of the great home run hitters swing at a ball, at the time it hits the ball, you know it's going to take off. That's what you like to see at breakouts. That's what I can see at market bottoms. You want to see the energy within the market bottom so you don't have to worry about it later on. You don't have to look at it every day. That's a really good way of putting it. Milton, what do you think about the semiconductors? You know, I personally have actually been quite long with semiconductors. Why are you short? The fact that you're short is making me a little bit nervous. It's not because I'm short, it's because they're in the market. SOXX, we're short the ETF. Let me show you why we're short. You're not going to believe it because, of course, we're short because you gapped up into the high. One side of the top. It's not the only time it gaps, you know. It gapped here, it wasn't the top. But it gapped into a high while Russell was making the isolated one day reversal. But more importantly, it's first down. The cycle, Montgomery cycle began on January 30th. So it peaked the day before the cycle. Its first down day was on the cycle day. And since there's a lot of emotion in the semiconductor stocks, as you know, it was up 185% of its lows, I think, in just less than three quarters of a year. It's up 145%. So there's a lot of emotion in the stock. It's something that should cycle. So we short it right now. Right now you had a gap up today, you know. I tell you, maybe we evaluate on Monday. I don't know. Let me see. The high yesterday was $335.47. The low today was $335.87. You had a $0.40 gap. I don't want to say it's bullish because it's very difficult to find bullish indicators exactly one day after a low. You see it. But usually you'll see it two days after a low or three days after a low. You saw it in 2025 in April, a day before the low. But we'll see. I might change my mind. I might cover my short on this. But if the market's going down, I think semi-stocks would lead to the downside. That's why I shorted it. And it was a cycle as well involved in it. Any other buyer sell signals or things you find interesting that have happened in this year? Well, the most interesting thing is we bought the Korea. Korea stocks look good. And we thought Chinese stocks is good. One of my biggest clients, my favorite clients, would not touch China because, and he's probably right, but I'm not as ethical as he is. He wouldn't buy China because they're a very non-ethical government, as you know, for many reasons. So they're non-capitalistic. But I always took the view that once a country prospers, ultimately it will become more ethical because just the way it's been, capitalism is the most ethical type of system as opposed to communism and socialism. But anyway, I saw Korea. I saw China. In the US, I didn't see things to buy. As far as things to sell, maybe we have to wait till the bear market dissolves before we find things to sell. I would say that the type of top we saw in Russell should tell you that Russell will lead to the downside. Fundamentally, the reason Russell leads to the downside is because there's many, I think 40% of the zombie companies in the Russell 2000. The Russell 2000 doesn't select for earnings, unlike the S&P indexes. The S&P 600, you have to have an earnings criteria to get into it. And the best companies in the Russell that grow their earnings, they go into the mid-cap index. Exactly. That's one of the problems. That's one of the problems considering a small cap, an asset class, because every time they rebalance it, you're losing the good companies. It's kind of funny. Definitely. All right, Melton. Thank you, Jack. I hope we only covered a small portion of what I prepared to speak about, but I think it was really fascinating and good. I hope you think so as well. Yes. We'll include the link in your description, both to your institutional service, but also the retail service where it's a much simpler read. If I can make an advertisement, the reason I charge $10 a month, this is what I said to myself. No one will turn this down because it's too expensive. No investor will turn it down because it's too expensive. Everyone should at least invest for a month or two months and take a look. They see nothing like it. And the best benefit is, it's not a trading portfolio. It's a portfolio for long-term investors with very, very few ins and outs. It's perfect for individual retail investors. Don't forget to go to RobPenn.com. And obviously, selling and getting out of the market before a crash is valuable, but getting back in the market is really- The most important thing, right. So much more valuable. I actually happened to have, quote, unquote, sold the top and been bearish before market crashes before, but mostly due to luck. Although, actually, maybe over 100% of it was due to luck because I had negative alpha at the time. But I didn't get back in that one time I'm thinking of, the 2020 crash. And that's just, if you nail the bottom, sorry, if you nail the crash, but you don't get back in, it's worse than just being 100% owning stocks. It really is. I'll tell you, to be honest with you, I've made the same mistakes you've made, but that's why I spent... I used to work... I managed three funds at Apple. I managed a lot of gold fund. I worked for Steiner. I worked for Soros. I worked for Drecky Bill. I managed money. But I spent the last 10 years just delving into research, really. And now I wouldn't make... I don't hope I wouldn't make the same mistakes because I will blindly follow the indicators rather than follow my emotions or follow what the headlines are telling you or follow what the economists are telling you. I just follow it. And the indicators are very robust. So everyone makes the mistake of missing the bottom. That's the worst mistake you can make. Fortunately, we built indicators strictly to call the bottoms. Absolutely. We'll leave it there. People can find you on Twitter. Thank you, everyone, for watching.
