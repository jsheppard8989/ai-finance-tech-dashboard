Today's episode is brought to you by the Picta AI Enhance International Equity ETF,
Ticker PQNT. You'll hear more about they're using AI to enhance international equity
returns later in the show. For now, let's get into it. Very pleased today to be joined
by Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize winning economist, distinguished professor and publisher
of the Paul Krugman Substack. Paul, welcome to Monetary Matters. How are you?
Uh, I'm good. It's good to be with you.
I know there's a lot of changes in the global trading order over the past year.
I want to ask you about that. But first, what about the US dollar? You, many other economists,
have long looked at the very large chronic current account deficits of the US dollar and thought
at some point this has to adjust. The dollar should weaken in order to level things out.
It hasn't. Why is that? It's certainly possible to run, you know, substantial current account
deficits forever. I mean, there is a first of all, there's the usual of the arithmetic of growth.
So, once you have a net that position, you can continue to run, you can continue to run
deficits as long as that position doesn't worsen as a share of GDP. It has worsen substantially
for the US as a share of GDP. But we're not yet. I mean, if we're thinking about what is the burden
of net net investment income payments by the US to the rest of the world exceeding payments by the
rest of the world to the United States, it's still not a huge negative number. So in terms of sheer
external debt, that's not a, that's not a killing constraint. The only thing you can say is that
this, uh, it cannot go on forever. Herbert Stein's law is something cannot go on forever. It will stop.
And this requires that the United States be an attractive investment destination. And how, you know,
how much does that continue? So look, uh, I don't think that the balance of payments is the biggest
issue for the, the dollar. It is true that at some point, uh, the United States does need to sort of
mostly pay its way in a world trade. But that's not an acute thing. It's much more a question
of the, uh, the uncertainties about the US, uh, domestic sea, the, the role of the dollar in
international finance and so on. So it's, it's about the domestic scene and it's role in,
it dollars role in international finance. What do you mean, how do you measure that? The dollar is
very special in the world. It's a, um, it is, you know, if the dollar is the money of money, it's the
international medium of exchange. If you want to exchange a Peruvia sauce for Malaysian ring it, um,
you don't try to find a trader who wants to do the reference. You basically it's either you or your
bank goes via the dollar, the dollar is the vehicle currency. It is the currency in which, in which
transactions are mostly settled. It's an invoice currency. So it's this, it's the unit of account
for a lot of trade, um, and and the international finance. It's, it's a, of store value. People hold
dollars, um, you know, official research, but much more important private, uh, uh, uh, investments
are awesome dollars and the or dollar denominated because they, it's the most, it's has been,
historically, you've seen as the safe haven. So all of that,
means that there is a little bit of special treatment. Now it's, it's also, you know, when the
United States is not unique in having run persistent trade deficits, the UK has done that or Australia has
done that, but the, um, but we probably get some extra edge from all of that and there is some
question. It's certainly a fun thing to talk about. I think maybe too much thought, but the international
role of the dollar, it sounds interesting, sexy, global. So a lot of people like to talk about a lot,
de-froning the dollar is actually much harder than people. I mean, uh, when people say, oh,
you know, well, they're, they're, they're Renn Indy replaced the dollar and I say, well, how
soon do you think that Mandarin would replace English as the language of international business,
right? And, and that's, and those are very similar things. All fantastic, uh, 60 year old essay
by Charlie Kendallberger about exactly that, uh, that analogy. And, um, the point is there's so much,
so much of world businesses and dollars that if you tried to, even if the U.S.
or became a hopeless, the untrustworthy partner, which we're working on, but anyway, they, um,
the dollar would probably persist for a long time anyway, but it can be eroded and there is some
sense that it's just, just between uncertainties about the United States, uh, and uncertainties
about, you know, is how much do people want to commit to doing transactions in a, in a currency
that we're, to some extent, at least they, they fear that maybe weaponized, um, we do see,
at least at the margins, some shift away from dollars, and that I think is, uh, those things
are what's weighing on the dollar now. You're talking about not how foreigners around the world
are selling dollars buying the ring gets buying gold, but that the marginal reserve dollar
is going into a pool of assets that on the margin has a slightly lower U.S. dollar U.S.
treasury content and higher diversified. Yeah. I mean, there may be some people selling it, but
the mass flight from the dollar, it would take a lot. It, we are, mean, um, it takes years and years
of, uh, of extremely irresponsible policy to turn yourself into Argentina for that way. And, um,
there's a tremendous, uh, weight of accumulates, um, uh, credibility, which, you know, with, it,
it is, we can talk, you know, about that, but it's, it's not easy. It, it would take a, uh, a
really sustained campaign of self-destruction to undermine the dollar's role. And, there's this huge
thing, which is the lack of alternatives. The, uh, the R&B is really not suitable, um, um,
Chinese capital controls among other things. The euro is still too fragmented, uh, you know,
uh, Bitcoin, we want to, there's a little bit of fun on the Bitcoin front lately, um, uh,
but it's really just not, not at all in, in the, in that universe. So, the, the biggest,
because it, in the worst case scenario, actually, the issue is not that the dollar might be replaced
by something else, but that the dollar might be replaced by nothing else, that we just have a
chaotic fragmented parent national monetary system, which is, you know, it's, if things go
really, really badly, that's where we end up, but that's, but not tomorrow, not next week.
What do you think moves currencies? Like if we look back from the, the dollar bear market from
2000 to 2008, what you might be the proximate cause, because you do have these huge chronic deficits
that you can say call it to it, but we also have this huge deficit now. Yeah, I, look, I've been on,
I've been in this international monetary theory business for an alarmingly long time,
and way back, when, when I, I was, I was just, I was in graduate school when we were just transitioning
to floating exchange rates, and there was a whole industry of people trying to develop equations
that predicted the value of the dollar, you know, prediction exchange rates. And after a while,
there was actually a sort of landmark study as ancient history now, but that showed that none of the
models out there did better at predicting exchange rates than a random walk. So, the answer is
fundamentally, we don't know. It's, it's, it's market expectations, which can come out of anywhere
that caused the dollar to move. And I don't think that there's up really, I mean, there is a
very, it turns out there is a measurable impact of interest rate differential. So, if you have a period
when the U.S. has relatively low interest rates, and other advanced cultures have relatively
high interest rates, you do have quite the dollar to weaken on average. But it's, it's there,
it's clear that it is clear that if you, you know, if you use enough data as a clue,
it's statistically significant relationship, but it's not all that strong. And then, other stuff,
you know, what's happening, I don't think we know what, what, what has caused it. There was clearly
a point in the, uh, and you go back to the Plaza Court, but again, we're going back to
the Asian history. There was clearly a point when the dollar really looked clearly overvalued,
and, um, and that got corrected. Um, there was a period that when the dollar was weak, that sort of
post, um, post.com bust and, uh, pre housing bust when, uh, U.S. interest rates were fairly low,
but in the end, uh, it's, it's a lot, it's sort of a currency version of the
old Paul Sandlison remark about the stock market that predicted nine of the last five recessions.
I think the other dollar has predicted probably nine of the last five economic crises.
You talked about the move to floating exchange rates. The end of Bretton Woods, I think the,
the IMF originally was set up to address those, uh, imbalances of payments. Now it is kind, you know,
serving to, to lend to countries around the world that, that, that need or, you know, kind of a
debt, debt stress. Um, do you think the IMF, or are, are global financial institutions like
the IMF or World Bank or, uh, the BIS? Are they powerful enough to sort of create the change that
is necessary? Like, if the world economy needs the Chinese you want to weaken, um, and, um,
you know, our global institutions, you're powerful enough to get the Chinese officials at the
table and kind of, uh, have, have them agree to something, some kind of accord? No, not, and especially
a current, there's always been a problem of asymmetry in the system, which is that surplus countries,
uh, that there's a lot of leverage over deficit countries, at least deficit countries and troubles,
almost known over surplus countries. And, uh, you know, in principle, the IMF is, well,
well, it'll do article four consultations on all that and tell you, you know, you're running an
access to surplus and countries will say, no, we don't think we are, and then what's the leverage.
Um, and my view of the IMF, I think the IMF is extremely useful. Sometimes harmful, but,
but not because it lacks power, but what the IMF really does is, it does provide some money,
uh, to countries and trouble. It's not that it's so much a source of money, although it's,
it can be significant, but mostly because it's a signal to other lenders that you've got an IMF
seal of approval. Um, and often, very often, the IMF is a useful villain that actually,
a country's own economic officials, no, perfectly well, that needs to take some hard measures,
that needs to, need to take some steps. Um, but they, um, they need somebody else to say,
you know, they're, they're forcing us to do this. And that's really, you know, IMF in Britain in the
70s or, uh, in many cases, I am, I am in, uh, many developing countries, uh, crises. The IMF
is just a useful, uh, uh, universally disliked authority figure that is helpful to sort of shift,
uh, to, to do what you need to do. Now, sometimes it can be, I think we can say that the,
the IMF, uh, and played a role in imposing excessive austerity on Southern Europe after
the Euro crisis, although really the IMF was actually the nice guy, the good cop in that and
the bad cops were the, uh, we're more, the, uh, European social bank and the, and the European
commission. So anyway, but the, uh, so the world, the, the world of, the world of other national
finances is kind of, it's, it's, it's kind of subtle. In some ways, there's a lot of, there's a lot
of, uh, uh, uh, surface appearances are not exactly what is really going on, which is okay. I'm
up to up to a point. If let's say the Chinese, you want is so weak, relative to the dollar,
and it's just so much more efficient to manufacture, uh, products when you pay people and you,
and your, your capital expense is in Chinese, you want rather than the expensive dollar. I mean,
are we doomed to not really make that many things in, in America? And, you know, at your,
on your Paul Krugman Substack, which is excellent, we can put up a chart of the, the Chinese,
you want real exchange rate, and how basically, you know, what we're fighting uphill, if you
want to make things in America, you're really fighting uphill, and you know, we're getting to
you ongoing trade with the US current administration as well, but regardless of who is in charge,
it is just talk about how challenging it is to have it to try and produce things in an overvalued
currency. No, that's right. Well, I'm not, yeah, the, um, uh, you want is clearly, well, it's a lot of,
you know, overvalued, undervalued, given the lack of the inadequacy of Chinese consumption demand,
uh, then in some sense, the macroeconomic says, well, they're going to export there. They're
excess savings. So they're going to run huge trade surpluses, and in some ways, the week, you
on is a reflection of that gap. What is really not sustainable is for China to be keeping their
economy going without sufficient domestic demand by exporting the demand deficiency via trade
surpluses. Um, that is a, that is a huge problem for everybody. Uh, it's actually a, it's a waste
for the Chinese as well. They're devoting a lot of resources to very low returning investments by
by running those paid surpluses. Um, but the, the, the check to that will not come from international
financial markets. It will not come from the IMF for sure. It will come from protectionism in the United
States. I think equally important in Europe. The fact of the matter is that that, uh, you can do all
you like in terms of academic arguments to say, well, better to take the cheap stuff, you know,
those cheap electric electric vehicles. The Chinese are doing something that is actually,
you know, it's great. They're giving us cheap electric vehicles and return for IOUs,
uh, that yield a very low rate of return. But, uh, it's just unacceptable in terms of the domestic
political economy. So the Chinese in their own interests should really turn this around. They,
you know, they should basically live live a better life and not run such big trade surpluses.
Um, and if they don't, then there will be a backlash. It's, it's just, um, this, the world cannot
go on this way for very long. What do you think's going to happen if it does? Oh, I think that the
European, the Europeans have, um, um, we, I mean, we already, the United States already has, you know,
uh, mostly very ill-concited, poorly designed, but the United States has thrown up a lot of
terms, I guess China. We have an average, average, average, average, average, average, average, average,
average, average, average, average, average, average, something like 30% percent right now off from around 10
before, um, before 2025. Um, the Europeans haven't done that yet, but they have the capacity to do that.
And the thing about Europe, Europe is disunited on many things, but the European Union is a customs union with a
common trade policy. So there will, um, not maybe not 2026, but, um, soon, and for the rest of our lives,
there will be a big European backlash as well. So I think that China is basically going to run into a
wall of tariffs, uh, by everybody, not just not just Trump, but everybody, uh, because, um, uh, because
the disruptive effect of those huge trade surplus is too large. Now, um, you know, I am not
obligatory. I'm not defending the Trump tariffs, uh, although China, I'm, I'm, I'm relatively
a whole, um, on China policy. Um, but, okay, that doesn't, that doesn't explain why we had massive
tariffs against Brazil or India. So, uh, the, in a way, the, uh, uh, I think what the United States
should be doing, and should be doing it concert with the Europeans, uh, and others, but especially
the Europeans, is that we should be, uh, sort of presenting a United Front to China saying you can't
do this. You cannot run trades for a pluses that large. We just, uh, uh, our societies can't handle it.
And one way or another, maybe in an uncool or in an inefficient fashion, that is what's going to happen.
I'm curious, your view on the similarities between tariffs and currency weakening is the, you know,
U.S. putting up tariffs, somewhat similar to the U.S. dollar weakening. And well, you're whether
similarities, what are the differences? And if I'm just making up the number, the Chinese
U. One is undervalued by 30% is putting a 30% tariff on China to level things out. Is that sound
economic policy? Well, the usual argument is there really two, uh, arguments for currency depreciation
and against, um, against relying on tariffs or protections of in general. Um, one of them is that, uh,
uh, tariffs, um, uh, don't provide an incentive for exports. So you're doing it all on the side
of import compression, which is his, his inefficient and means sacrifice, the ability to kind of
concentrate on what you're pretty good at doing, which is what you export. Um, and the other is the
tariffs tend to be very uneven, that they are, uh, or protection of, in general. You end up giving,
uh, some sectors get more protection on others. There's a, there's a tremendous potential for,
uh, rent seeking, seeking, you know, getting, getting exemptions or, uh, or selective protections
based upon political influence, uh, in some cases corruption that's, uh, that's the generic thing.
We've been talking about rent seeking in economics for more than half a century. Uh, and the, uh,
uh, and then I'd add that if you're going to do the tarry, you know, the, the United
State dollar is not clearly undervalued against, uh, overvalued against the euro or the
Canadian dollar, whatever. Uh, it's, so if your problem is vis-a-vis China, then cross the board
tariffs, which is, you know, we do have highly uneven tariffs, but they're, uh, but they're still
all loved tariffs on countries that are not named China, and that's a bad thing. Uh, I would
add one other thing that isn't interesting point about tariffs, uh, which is the, on the one hand,
it's a problem that where the tariffs are being imposed, differentially, uh, on the other hand,
the, uh, the differential tariffs are themselves a, uh, a source of costs, um, Richard Baldwin,
my old student, although now our approaching retirement age himself, but they were in, in, uh,
in Geneva, um, had an excellent analysis, reported out that, uh, one of the things that the
current structure of U.S. tariffs does is it encourages, instead of encouraging production in the
United States, it encourages sourcing our imports from higher cost countries. So we buy something
from Vietnam or Mexico, even if it costs more to import it from there, they're from China, which ends
up, uh, doesn't actually do anything from U.S., uh, manufacturing, but it does mean that we pay
more for our imports than we would otherwise, so it's just a pure loss. So the, the current, the,
the, the right way to do this, and it's not just currency values, right? The currency value in some
ways is endogenous. I'm finding it hard, not to do it calling the speed, but the currency value
is endogenous, uh, a realignment of macro policies, which is definitely trying that needs to consume
more. There, there, there's still, you cannot, uh, save 40 plus percent of GDP when your growth
rate is not, it's no longer 9%. Um, and to a certain extent, the rest of us, uh, need to
bring our own, uh, consumption in line with, with our incomes here, the United States, most
we have, we have, uh, large fiscal deficits, the Europeans do as well, they're not on the same scale.
So, uh, kind of macro realignment, which would necessarily be a company by currency realignment,
all of which is going to happen. Well, as soon as we have sensible people running poll, the
world's major economies, so how long is that clock? It's often that a con, I find economists will say
that the source of the chronic, um, chronic out deficit is really, you got to look at the fiscal
deficit, but why do you start with the fiscal deficit and, and also haven't you, um, been someone
who's been on the side for, for, you have 20 plus years of saying actually fiscal deficits are
sustainable and in, you know, they, they can be good things when the economy's, uh, need stimulus.
Yeah, they definitely can be good things when the economy needs stimulus. Um,
right now we don't. And, um, uh, one thing that is still not fully, I don't fully understand.
I don't think anyone does is that if you go back to pre-COVID, it was very clear that our star,
the, uh, the sort of sustainable real interest rate was very low and well below the economy's
growth rate. And that situation debt is really not a problem. That is no longer the case. We're now
looking at, I mean, the interest rates are much, much higher than they were. Um, they're
clearly higher than the, uh, sort of long run growth rate of the economy. Um, and, uh, and we
not, we're not in a recession. So that's telling you sort of on a PPE basis as a proof of the
putting is in the eating that our star has moved way up. Now why that should be the case is an
interesting question. But the, the arithmetic that was pro that basically said relax about debt
deficits in 2019 does not say that in 2020. Six. There's a, because interest rates are so much
higher relative to, uh, to growth. Potential growth has probably slowed. Let's see what, what AI
actually does for us, but potential growth appears to have slowed interest rates are way higher.
We are not in a recession. Um, we appear, you know, it's possible that actually the, um,
the tech building boom, maybe that goes away. Um, but also we have moved from, um, a fundamental
level deficits are now looking much more persistent than ingrained than fiscal deficits than,
than they did in, in the 2010s. So, uh, it, it's a quite different world. And they, uh, all I
could say is that if, um, uh, if you, you kind of have to go with with what the numbers are telling
you. And the numbers are not telling it all the same story that they did in 2019. I want to,
want to ask you about our star in later. But, but just, you said that the, the math does not support
large deficits like it did 2019 because interest rates are higher. That's very interesting to me.
It kind of sounds like you're kind of the CFO of, oh, when interest rates are at 1%,
we're going to borrow as much as possible. And when interest rates are at 15%, we're going to
make sure that we don't, we don't have to borrow as much. Uh, is that to tell us about that view,
because there are those who say interest rates don't matter. And if, if interest rates are high,
but the economy needs deficits, it should have deficits. And if, uh, you know, your, your Germany,
and you don't, you're in, uh, the surplus is what's needed, even if interest rates are zero,
don't borrow. Okay. So, um, you know, if interest rates are high, that tells you right away that
if the economy needs stimulus, you'll need to have some room for monetary stimulus. I mean,
the whole point of the, the sort of post global financial crisis world was that we had cut interest
rates to zero. And we still had persistent weakness. And that would, we really needed fiscal
stimulus there. And the same condition that says monetary policy doesn't, has, is very hard to
get any traction. It's also the situation on the which deficits are not a big problem, because borrowing
is so cheap. So that was a world in which fiscal deficits for stimulus made a lot of sense.
It's also the case. And the CFO story is kind of right. Um, if you ask, look at the, look at the
situation in 2013, say, when the U.S. economy was still quite depressed, employment was low, monetary policy
was added, suddenly conditional monetary policy was added to limit the interest rate was added
zero lower bound or it's lower lowest bound. Um, and, uh, we also had lots of
public investment needs as we still do. Uh, that would be a great time to borrow a lot of money
and invest it on infrastructure invested on, actually, and a lot of other things that come out to
invest. Um, child nutrition and health care is, is, is an investment as much as roads and bridges
are. Um, so, but we, and we didn't do that. Uh, we, we were constantly being lectured about
the evils of deficits that exactly the time when we should have been running deficits and investing them.
Um, and Germany, wow, uh, Germany is a, uh, is actually a, it's, it's a cautionary tale,
because they were, is a, uh, congratulating themselves on their discipline on the, the shards on
the, the Black Zero and, um, uh, and now we're getting all these stories about how, you know,
the trains and Germany are worse than the trains in Britain, which is true and it's kind of
astonishing because I, I haven't got a lot of traveling on German trains, but I've done a lot of
traveling on British trains and it's not great, you know, it's really terrible. So the Germans have
really clearly, they, they ran balance budgets to kept their debt burden down and they're clearly
worse off as a result. They've allowed their infrastructure to, to deteriorate quite badly. So
that there are times certainly, uh, when you have a low interest rate environment, um, and the
weak economy, yeah, that's when deficit spending is a good thing to do. As soon as AI tools begin
to wow the world, investors started asking when will AI driven strategies become more common?
The answer is that they're already here sophisticated quant hedge funds have been using
machine learning strategies for many years, largely only for the benefit of institutional
investors paying higher fees. Now, with the barriers to usage coming down, AI machine learning
approaches are being made available to you through products like the Picta AI Enhanced
International Equity ETF, Ticker PQNT. Piquant gives investors enhanced international returns in a
low cost tax-efficient wrapper, using AI to take advantage of the types of hidden out-performance
potential that human beings may not be able to detect or explain. An unlike many other active ETFs,
Piquant isn't just taking factor risk, leaving you overexposed to specific sectors and betas
or style exposures. Instead, Piquant helps neutralize factor exposure to minimize index tracking
error. That means when it outperforms, it's coming from true idiosyncratic stock returns,
not excessive risk or factor exposure. To learn more about how you can harness the power of AI

Distributed by foresight fund services. Now back to the show. You mentioned R-star,
the theoretical rate that is neither stimulated nor contractionary or the economy.
Why do you think that R-star has moved up? I'm a little baffled. I mean, I have some stories,
but they do run. They are problematic. So, it seems pretty clear that R-star has gone up.
The fact that we've had, I mean, when the Fed began raising interest rates in 2022,
a lot of people said, oh, that's that leads to a recession. The fame is Bloomberg
model that said the chance of recession was 100%. It didn't happen. And the fact that
interest rates came up so much, you didn't have a recession. It's part of phase-year evidence
that R-star was higher than it had been. Now why? I mean, we had a story for a while,
but I have to say right now, a lot of the, when we talked about secular stagnation, which is
terrible term, but basically means R-star very low. When we talked about secular stagnation,
one of the big stories we gave was democracy, that the combination of aging population,
basically aging populations, very low or negative growth in working-age population,
certainly in prime age working in population, that that meant limited investment
opportunities, and that was leading to a low R-star. That situation has not improved.
Certainly in the United States, prospective growth in the working-age population has
flatlined, not because, I mean, not because there was a big drop in the birth rate 20 years ago,
but because our policies and immigration have radically changed. And we appeared to have gone
from a really large immigration surge a couple of years ago to, depending, you know,
the numbers are flaky. Keeping accurate numbers on undocumented immigrants are sort of
by definition hard to produce, but depending on your estimates, either way down or has actually
turned, net migration may even have turned negative. And the demand, demographic story would
say if anything R-star should be down. Now, maybe we certainly have a lot of investment spending
being driven by AI, and that might be a source of excess demand, of increased demand for funds,
and a strong economy, although some doubts, there's a lot of import content in that spending,
and manufacturing construction, if there's only part of it, but certainly that, that has actually turned
down since late 2024, mostly because at the end of, of re-energy subsidies.
So, exactly what's happening, I go, no, and actually the most nihilistic version I've seen
is that the economy's not actually the old-time responsive to interest rates, and therefore,
it's really very hard to pin down where R-star is, or maybe we've just
exaggerated that the precision and all of this whole along the way. And it's an interesting question,
you know, we were all, me too, or saying, you know, we deeply responsible to do the 300-bases
point-cut interest rates that the President wants, but how much difference would that make?
Actually, we don't know. But I have to say that there's a lot of fog, the reality that we
have much higher interest rates than we did in early 2022, and yet the economy is still
charging along is clear. And we had had a huge boom, just before we had this conversation,
I really had lines about the massive spending that that hyper-stailers and AI are planning to undertake
all this tremendous capbacks, which you would think would be a major source of stimulus.
I mean, it's a little bit like, I've been in the business too long, but I remember in the
end of the late 1990s there was a bit that the puzzle was, why is business investment so strong?
And the answer is, it was actually very much tech, not so much.coms as telecoms.
It was just a lot of spending on the new technology, much of which turned out to be
at any rate, premature, but there was, and there could be something like that going on.
I'm a little nervous because some, though not all of my, the people I trust on these things,
are estimated a very high import content for AI-related spending. There's an awful lot of
chips produced in Taiwan and even in China in those data centers. So it may not be as much
of a stimulus to the U.S. economy as the headline numbers would suggest, but on the other hand,
the construction is really, and until the few days before we had this conversation, the stock
valuations were certainly boosting high consumption by high wealth individuals. So it's possible
that will wake up a year from now or two years from now and say, well, that thing above
higher, our star, that was all, that was all the AI bubble, but we don't know there.
Just going back to immigration, I kind of hadn't been paying enough attention to it, but I think
it really is important. So there was a large influx of migration into the U.S. from
your 2020-2024, you know, and that is sharply reversed. Are you saying that the more the population
goes up, the higher the natural interest rate should be because there's just more demand
and overall GDP is higher. And so, yeah, now you're saying that because net migration is down
and maybe even be negative that our star might actually be lower, I've got to say,
Professor Krubin, you are actually in agreement with the Fed Governor Myron, or former Fed
Governor Myron, who actually made that argument on this very show. So you do agree with him that
the Fed should cut interest rates because migration is so negative now.
Well, the problem is we don't know enough to be to go that way, but it's, it's certainly not what
you see in the economy right now. So the point is, right now we have, if we look at the macro
situation right now with GDP apparently still growing pretty fast and not labor market,
it's a weird labor market, but it doesn't look like it's a, it's a weak labor market by the
conventional definition and inflation kind of black that's at a, you know, the macro situation
would not call for large interest rate cuts. Looking forward, so I don't think this is helpful
in deciding monetary policy now. I don't think the FOMC should be looking at the immigration
just yet, but if we try to ask what will, what will our star look like two or three years down
the pipe? There's a reasonable case, the sharply reduced immigration should reduce it because
it's, um, go back to the, you know, what determines investment and this is very old logic,
which is still, I think, correct called the accelerator principle, which says that investment
demands should depend less on the level of GDP than on the rate of growth of GDP,
because if your economy is growing, then you need new office buildings, new, uh, new
investments and services at their, uh, new housing, it should depend on GDP level on GDP
rate of change or the rate of change of the rate of change. No, the rate of change, not the rate of
change. I mean, uh, you can slip a derivative, but two derivatives is too far, but, um, um, and look,
Japan entered the world of very low interest rates, ten years, ten, ten plus years before
the rest of the advance world. Uh, the reason they did the usual story, uh, which is the story that
makes a lot of sense is that the, that Japan had the demographic apocalypse sort of, uh, well,
ahead of the rest of us that Japan, between low fertility rates and, uh, historical,
aversion to immigration, Japan's working-age population began shrinking in the 1990s, and
if the working-age population is shrinking, then you don't need a lot more office buildings,
you don't need more factories, you don't need new houses, because household formation is not
rising up. You still have some of that. You need to replace stuff that wears out and as,
as living standards rise, people want bigger houses and more comfortable offices,
but the, the level of a desk that you can justify is substantially lower in a,
a low population or zero or negative population growth environment. By the way, that's,
you know, we were talking earlier about China. If you asked, you know, what's, why is China
having, uh, a problem? What they have a very low consumption of high savings society,
and, um, which was workable when their economy was growing rapidly and when they're working-age
population was growing, because that, uh, that meant that there was a lot of demand for
building new stuff. Now that China has, China has had a working, the shrinking,
working-age population, and now a shrinking overall population for, for quite a while,
um, very hard to justify the investment. So the same, you know, China,
and since some ways, one of the most acute victims of, of this demographic issue, um, so I
think that's a, that if you had asked, if you told me about what was happening to U.S.
demography in 2025, I would have said, well, that should, that should mean that the, the issue
of low R star has set to a stagnation would become even more intense. Now it has not, at least,
not so far, is that just a blip is that they bubble, I don't know, but I have to say that
that I'm a law, I thought, I thought I had this thing fairly well understood back at, you know,
on the eve of COVID. And now I'm not, now it's, it, it does look kind of post like maybe,
I'm sure there are people who are quite confident that they know what's going on, but I'm not.
The relationship between demographics and debt and debt to GDP, when the society is older
and having fewer kids, uh, the working-age share of the population goes down, so there's more
increased population, uh, percentage who are on things like social, social, so it's already,
uh, does that mean basically as the world ages that debt to GDP is just kind of in a
secular bull market for many, many decades? And, you know, I mean the UN, again, what
do you know, what the forecasters know, although actually forecasts about demography are actually far
more accurate than forecast about many other things, you know, particularly economic. And they
forecast, I mean things like, you know, in, in, in China by 2,100, there's going to be more senior
citizens than non-seniors citizen adults. Um, yeah. It's where we, where we're going. And I also want
to say, you, there have been tons of people doom and glooming about the US debt to GDP,
particularly like 10 years ago, and you were saying, hold on not so fast. It's not that big of a
deal. There's not going to be a crisis. And in the short term, you know, you were wrong. They were,
sorry, sorry. You were right. They were wrong. You know, Paul Kruehn won them zero. But like long term,
what are you seeing? And, you know, in, is the Paul Kruehn of in 2080 going to be, you know,
be saying, hey, I mean, you know, debt to GDP, a 500 percent. It's sustainable. And we'll he be right.
Okay. So, generally speaking, debt to GDP is kind of secondary in these discussions.
Uh, it is, it is there. But again, the historically advanced countries, advanced countries
that are seen as having mostly responsible governments and stable societies can get away with all
a lot of Britain, after World War II had debt to GDP of 250 percent. And there was no crisis.
Now, are we, did, does America look like that to you? Well, that's, that's a, that's a, that's a
question that probably outside the scope of this discussion. But, um, the, um, but the, the
demography thing is less about what happens to the debt GDP ratio that it is about just the, um,
if you like the, the transfer burden. Um, we have a, uh, you know, every
adapted economy has a fairly extensive welfare state. Even the United States does, although ours
is his less generous in many ways than than than than than than other countries. Um, and all
welfare states, although ours is inexceptible in this talk, involve a lot of taxing of working age
people to pay benefits to older people. Um, and that, you know, that's, that's going to be an
inherent, um, partly retirement benefits, partly that it's cost, health care, even for healthy
senior citizen costs, and awful lot more that does for, for a 25 year old. Um, so there is always a
problem. If you, if there's only a question of how many workers are there to support, he, um,
retiree or at least senior citizen. Um, and that's not the, the level of debt, and even the interest
payments on the debt are actually quite small compared with the burden of just providing income
and health care to older people. So that, that is a, that demographic thing is an issue. Um, it's,
it's not quite, well, I haven't seen revised, I don't think we've been able to revise the
projections right now that the numbers that we were looking at, uh, before, uh, that we were looking
at even in 2024 said that the demographic shift was going to be significant, but not killing,
that the, um, the, um, the, uh, if take the, um, uh, Social Security, that the age dependency ratio,
right, the, the, the, um, the dependency ratio of Social Security beneficiaries to, um, people
paying into the system, um, a lot of that rise has already happened. And so people started the baby
when we started hitting 65 or even more 62 when a lot of people do retire, um, in, before 2010.
And so a lot of, we're already well into that transition and there isn't that much where to go
from shared demography, but if you, uh, or there wasn't, and then if you include, uh, uh,
if we had were able to limit the rate of growth of healthcare costs, then it wasn't that severe.
But if you reduce, working age population growth from 1% to 0, uh, then those issues become a lot
or severe. So the long term sustainability, uh, uh, and you know, I say it's Medicare,
Medicare Medicaid and Social Security, because Medicaid, well, the most of the recipients are
young, most of the benefits go to the elderly. Um, those are, that becomes a much more problematic thing.
And I don't think it's, you know, if, if you could suddenly wipe out half of US federal debt,
that would make almost no difference to the sustainability of the system fundamentally, uh,
weak demography is a problem for any system that has a lot of beneficiaries who are
we're getting on in years. But I want to ask you about AI, you referenced it earlier.
The huge amounts of, of catbacks, I see estimates of, you know, maybe $5 or $600 billion
for the US in 2026. Honestly, I think it could be a little bit higher.
Um, that is, I don't know, roughly one, one and a half percent of USGP, when you, when you look
at the history of giant capex booms, whether it was the dot com telecom boom, uh, railroads or,
or other things, what tends to happen? And why? Okay. So there's a pretty consistent story,
which is that these big big booms and capex generated by optimistic about new technology,
uh, do end up in some kind of grief that there's a, um, and so what we're looking at right now
is something that is grass, it's, it's, it's only getting up so far, growth GDP to be something
comparable to the late 90s, mostly telecoms capex boom. Uh, so it's, it's not, despite the
immensity of the numbers, it's not completely out of bounds. Um, it's not remotely on the
sad skill as, uh, has the railroad booms of the 19th century, which were sometimes 6% of GDPs.
So, uh, but what, what has typically happened is that even when the technology is really,
really does pay off, and I can't, I, I have no independent, uh, judgment on AI. The one thing I will
say is that while mostly, I personally find that annoying people who've dignity people in the,
doing coding are really, really think that, that claw is, is, is revolutionary. So maybe it's a big
payoff, but is it a payoff to the company is doing the capex? And that's the problem. The telecoms
was was for real, because no question that, uh, and the, uh, the internet was a, it's, well,
we're, that they didn't show up more in productivity growth, and nonetheless, the internet was
clearly a valid, important technology, and our lives were all very different because of it,
but the companies that did the big spending in many cases did not survive. So, it's, it seems,
you know, historical precedent is that that's going to happen again. I would particularly,
this is just subjective. What do I know? But the, you do have the feeling that these kind of
aging, behemoths of the tech industry. I'm referring to the companies, not the, not the leaders
of all, maybe that too. But these, um, that they are spending vast amounts that attempt to hang on
to their, to their youth, or way to, um, that they, it is kind of the amazing, it's just very different
from the telecoms, that the big spending that was coming from companies that were already
entrenched in compens that are trying to practically dig their most deeper. And that, that doesn't sound,
that doesn't go very well. It doesn't vote very well for society, maybe, but in, the fact that
the biggest and most profitable companies are the ones doing the spending might that mean that this
is, you know, in the short term, a little more sustainable, they're, they're not just having to,
you know, borrow tons of money to do that, although that's having to. Yeah, that's happened.
It, that changed in the last year. Beginning of 2025 because, well, this retained earnings,
it's, it's not great if they're wasting a lot of their retained earnings, but,
no threat to financial stability, but now a lot of it is debt. So it really is starting to look
problematic. And, um, yeah, I mean, the, I, I worry, again, what do I know? But the subjectively,
it does feel as if the, um, there's a, a lot of money is being sunk into dairy large sort of
universal models in the United States. While the Chinese are working on sort of smaller,
more application of specific models. And it looks like there's a pretty good chance that the
Chinese have got it right and we've got it wrong. And that's, that's another reason to be skeptical
about where we're going, but, again, I shouldn't even weigh it because what do I know? That's, um,
this is one of those areas where I want to consult the genuine experts in the problem is that
this is one of the situations where you can find a genuine expert to tell you whatever it is you
want to hear. So, anyway, very, very true. Um, Kevin Worsch, president Trump and he nominated him
to do, do be the next chair of the Federal Reserve. You wrote on your sub-stack Paul Krugman.
This is a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve. Why? Okay, previous Ted Cheers, even,
liberal conservative presidents had been, clearly, they've been chosen with an eye towards
competence towards reassuring the business community. Um, Worsch, you know, among the
front runners in the Trump beauty contest may have been the least alarming, but that's, he's not
anybody that I think anyone would have named as a desirable Fed chair, worried not for his political
credentials. And he'd been very much political animal, community. I threw up some scrappy
charts on my sub-stack. The economists now has a much more carefully done chart that says the same thing
that Worsch very clearly, his views on, he's not a, he's not a hawk. He's a hawk when a Democrat
is in the White House. He's a, he's a, he's a dove when a Republican is in the White House and he's
angling for the job of Fed chair. That's not a happy record to have someone going into. And I have
actually read some of Worsch's speeches on lottery policy over the years. And it's not so much
that I disagree with his conceptual framework as that I can't figure out what the conceptual framework
is. I don't think there really is one. I think it's kind of a, a lot of free-floating criticism and,
and difficult language that ends up being a, a smoke screen. Now, you know, we, this is,
nobody was, I have, mostly I know people who are ex-fet staff, who were in the central banking
world, and almost everybody is really quite unhappy that we've come to this. Now, probably
Worsch won't do that much damage at least to monetary policy, but this is, this is a real degradation
in, in, in, in the process and the criteria for selecting a Fed chair. This is the most important
economic position in the world, or what do you, in the hands of somebody who have a lot of
credibility at the Fed. And the idea that, that, that, that, guilty to, to the President of the United
States, it was clearly a key consideration. That, that is a completely humiliation for Fed.
And if there is one coherent principle that, that Worsch has been very steady on it, it certainly
is, Kevin Worsch has been associated with, with the view that the Fed's balance sheet is too big,
and they shouldn't be in the business of having a big balance sheet. What is your view of, of that
claim and might this be a world where he's going to be very hawkish on the balance sheet,
which will allow him to cut rates in a way that the President will approve of?
Well, I don't think it, uh, uh, okay. My general view, first of all, it is important to understand
how did the Fed gets this bad big balance sheet? It wasn't that there was this imperial driver.
This was the Fed trying desperately to cope with the post financial crisis world in which
the economy was depressed despite zero interest rates, and fiscal policy was not coming to their aid.
And so the Fed was trying to get some strength. I did so by, with large scale assets purchases,
and quantitative easing, and, um, now I'm, uh, I'm a QE skeptic.
I don't think the QE was very effective. And in some ways, the fact that we're still debating
whether it was effective is kind of an indication that what certainly wasn't decisively effective.
But by the same token, uh, I then, uh, I don't think that the size of the Fed's balance sheet
matters very much. It, uh, that if buying $2 trillion of longer term assets didn't do very much
to stimulate the economy, then having the Fed hold $2 trillion of longer term assets doesn't really
do a lot of harm either. So I, and my take on the intellectual history here is that people who
warns that QE would be dangerous in inflationary back in 2010, when that didn't pan out,
as to say, well, okay, maybe I was wrong. They said, a QE is terrible because at least
of the bloated balance sheet that is really a, it's really more of a attempt to keep the same
policy recommendations, even though the facts have changed. So I, yeah, uh, it's the, the idea that
that I just don't think that the, does balance sheet is, in fact, a very important economic issue.
I wouldn't be terribly upset to be strong because I don't think it might matter that much.
But then, uh, I don't think, it for, for the same reason, I don't think that it,
that's shrinking the balance sheet would give you a lot of the way to cut the Fed funds rate.
Maybe not true economically way, but, uh, politically, I think, I think, I think it, it might,
well, I don't know if, I mean, politically, who's politics? I mean, we're really not talking about,
about the electorate, which doesn't know about any of this. And we're really not talking
about Donald Trump, who has his own views regardless, um, we're really talking about
convincing the rest of the FOMC. Yeah. And I don't think that the FOMC
mostly would be happy to sharp the cut, um, target Fed funds rate in a environment where inflation
is above target, um, no matter how much quantitative, uh, tight think takes place. Professor, it, it is,
you know, I, I was not an adult during this time. So I fortunately, you know, wasn't able to say
something potentially, you know, stupid about it, but, um, you were saying quantitative easy was not
going to be inflationary. There were those saying Fed expanding its balance sheet would be,
we know you were right, but what, I mean, was it obvious at the time? Like, I think, you know,
the central bank monetary base going up by so much, I think, you know, it turns out you were right,
but was there like an economic law that that you would be? Well, on your territory, right?
Well, there was this analysis, uh, uh, of Japanese policy, um, Krugman 1998, which predicted
um, that that large increases of the monetary base would basically achieve nothing, would do nothing,
would be completely, um, uh, sterile in a, and a zero interest rate environment. Uh, we did have,
there was actually, what's the most kind of, the fact that was a big increase in the monetary base
and in, um, in, in the 1930s that did nothing. Uh, there was a, uh, the Japanese a little bit
after I wrote that paper, but the Japanese did their own version of qualitative easing with, uh,
well, at the time seemed like a big increase in the monetary base and nothing happens. So we had
a fair bit of historical evidence on a theoretical framework. There, there, I mean, it's kind of
technical question, which is what is the elasticity of substitution between long-term and short-term
assets and how much does Fed, did the Fed buying, yes, departing from its historical practice and buying
a lot of longer-term bonds, how much did that change the margin? And, uh, you could, there was some
possibility that that it would have a bigger effect. In fact, you know, there was also,
there were, back around the time that we were all talking about Japanese policy, the, um,
there was another guy named Ben Bernaki who thought that you could get substantial traction
by buying longer-term assets. So it was a debatable point, but I think in, in reality, the scale of
those purchases was enormous. No question. We saw a huge expansion of the monetary base via
the, uh, personal-term assets, and it looked like it's a, it was a lot closer to my view that
which was that, uh, fundamentally, you should think of, of the long-term, of long-term rates as
expected future short-term rates. Then it was to the view that there were really distinct
asset classes that, and that by changing the qualities on the, on the open market, you could get
substantial changes in rates. Final question for you, Paul, is it about the inflationary impacts
of tariffs, uh, during April, many economists specifically, uh, you know, on many news channels,
is going to be so inflationary, the actual stated inflation rate has remained fairly stable.
I know you've been looking at some work showing that actually, the, the prices, uh, you know,
may have gone up. Oh, is the conclusion of that that had there been no tariffs, the inflation rate
would be about 2% now? Well, or, yeah, I mean, it's, um, uh, that's what they, there's a lot of
slippage. There's, I wouldn't stake my life on any of these estimates, but micro-data suggests
the tariffs have raised prices by about 1% relative to what they would have been without them,
which does say, yeah, inflation rate would be something like 2% without them. Um, and the, um,
people who are making things about runaway inflation, that's not what the models ever said.
I mean, the importance of, of goods are about 11% of GDP. Um, the actual increase
in tariffs rates, effective tariffs rates is like 10% of points. It's not, um, it's not a, uh, it's,
it's less than the headline numbers, because there are a lot of carve outs and, uh, and ways for firms
to do, uh, to avoid big difference between the words avoid a debate. A lot of ways for firms to avoid.
I don't think it's smuggling as big as you, but avoidance in one way or another is an issue. So,
you know, talking about 10% is points on 1.1% of GDP, 11% of GDP, that would deal, like a price hit
up 1.1%, uh, even, uh, they deal budget, uh, labs says 1.2% actual is 1 or if you compare inflation
in 2025 with broadcasts made in late, uh, 2024, it's 0.9% points higher, because people are
expecting continuing disinflation. There's not a huge gap. Uh, basically there was, I think people
still know how the, all of it, inflation will, will skyrocket because of tariffs stuff. Um,
that was a little bit of, uh, of height. The, the numbers are not wildly off what you would
expect. The numbers are not wildly off and yet the was inflationary, my, my only inflationary of
mildly 0.9% 1% which, you know, still is pretty big. Paul, thank you so much for coming on
monetary matters to, to prepare for the city where I read a lot of your work on the Paul Krugman
sub-stack. It's, it's very good already one of the most popular sub-stacks. Uh, tell us what are
you ready about obviously you're an extremely accomplished economist, but you also have a political
commentary. What is kind of the split between politics, economics, and what, uh, you know, what kind
of audience, you know, my audience, definitely subscribe to the sub-stack of what kind of audience
member are you looking to write for? Wow. Uh, I mean, it is for, I, I'm trying for a kind of 6040
of economics versus politics. And, um, the, uh, and it varies with with the time and, and my
audience is mostly relatively, you know, it's not mostly technical people, but I will go
want here now and then. It's, but at some level, I thought of it as originally as being a
want here thing that it has turned out to be, but that's partly because, you know, it's got
got more than 500,000 subscribers. I feel to some extent I got a survey readership, so it, it's, it's a
much. Uh, thank you again. Appreciate everyone watching, leave a rating and review for monetary
