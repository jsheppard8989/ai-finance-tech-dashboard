Today's episode is brought to you by the Picta AI Enhance International Equity ETF,
Ticker PQNT. You'll hear more about they're using AI to enhance international equity
returns later in the show. For now, let's get into it. I'm joined today by a stalwart
in the commodity space Rick rule of Rick rule investment media. Rick, welcome to monetary matter.
So glad to be speaking to you today. Pleasure to be with you, Jack. I'm delighted that you've
progressed to having your own channel. Thank you very much. Rick, like a lot of people who are
professionals in the commodity space, you are a long-term bull on not just precious metals,
but many other commodities. However, looking at your recent commentary, you have appeared to
strike a little bit of a note of caution and you've been talking about the needs for
current contrarianism. You can choose your time horizon, but share how you're looking at the
gold and silver markets right now. Over the course of the next 10 years, I'm a precious metals bull.
I think the arithmetic of America, the unbalanced sheet debts and in particular the $120 trillion
and net present value of entitlement liabilities means that the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar
declines substantially. I believe in fact that the U.S. dollar over the next 10 years will lose
75% of its purchasing power. That has profound implications for people who live on picked incomes,
as an example. And it also has profound implications for gold and silver. I think they'll maintain
their purchasing power, which means that their nominal price appreciation should match in some
way shape reforms. The deterioration of purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. That said, gold gave me
too much too fast. I believe that the move that we enjoyed in 2024, 2025, was a coil spring move,
which is to say that the set of circumstances was present in 2020. The same so the
circumstances is 2024, but nobody paid attention. So the incredible moves that we've gotten recently,
I would like into a coiled spring, releasing the tension from a market that needed to move.
That tension has been released. So we don't have to have the same kind of price moves in
2020, 6 that we enjoyed in 2025. The difficulty is that the move that we enjoyed in 2024 and 25
have put in place a narrative. And I think people who adhered to that narrative are going to be disappointed
and probably sell in frustration in 2026. And as a consequence of that, miss out on what I think
will be a very solid move for the next decade. Pass this prologue here, Jack. I'm old enough to
remember well the decade of the 70s. In the decade of the 70s, the U.S. dollar lost 75% of
its purchasing power. According to the Congressional Budget Office, not coincidentally, over the
period of the decade of the 70s, the gold price ran from $35 an ounce admittedly price controlled
to $850 an ounce. And the silver price ran from a buck and a half to $50. Passed this prologue,
probably not to the same dimension, you know, the same extent. But past is prologue. The decade of the
70s was very hard for people on fixed incomes. It obliterated long bond portfolios. It was very good
or people who were invested in investment instruments where their price are purchasing power kept
pace with inflation. Gold and silver, by the way, is not the only way to do that. If you remember
back to the decade of the 70s or more specifically to the period 1968 to 1982, we had an equities
market that went at best sideways, mostly down. And yet some securities, particularly those owned by
Warren Buffett companies that had purchasing power, generated for Warren Buffett over 14 years,
a 23 or 24% compound internal rate of return. So it isn't as though gold and silver are the
only ways to protect yourself from the deterioration of purchasing power. They are however the only
simple ways to protect your purchasing power. And as a consequence of that, I'm an adherent. What you
find in Natural Resources is that the timeframes that you have to commit to are fairly long. You may
not know Jack, but at rule investment media, I have for free graded almost 100,000 portfolios
in 35 years. Looking at 100,000 portfolios has taught me a lot about the way people invest and the
mistakes they make. The mistakes are broadly as follows. Most people, if they understand an
narrative, don't invest in the narrative until the price action of the commodity that's talked
about the narrative already performs, which is to say nobody wanted to buy silver at $20
an ounce and everybody wanted to buy it at $60 an ounce. This is just flat stupid, but it's the way
the people are. Further, in commodities broadly, capital intensive cyclical businesses, you are
either a contrarian or you're going to be a victim. Those are your two choices. The market's
work. The cure for high prices is always high prices and the cure for low prices is always
low prices. The second thing is that investors are unnerved by volatility. There are price
moves and commodities and equities. In the junior equities, 15% price moves are commonplace.
Really, they just represent the market in hailing and exhaling. Nothing more. What people are
unnerved about that. I suspect they're unnerved because they don't have an opinionist. The value
of the security they own is a consequence they react to prices. If you can't handle volatility,
you need to be a very, very, very, very circumspect investor. The third thing is that most
investors don't do enough work. Most investors, money is made in investing on the delta between
price and value. Price information is easy to get, but it has no utility if you don't have an
opinionist of value. Most people haven't done the work around valuations and it's a consequence
they pay slavish attention to price, which is a huge mistake. Further to that, most narratives
take longer to work out than people hope. Many investors are good strategically. They invest in
copper because they think over 10 years the copper price will do well. Do shortages. That's a 10-year
thesis. And if you have a 10-year thesis, but you have trauma-holding stock over a long weekend,
the juxtaposition between the time required for the narrative to come true and the time you
allow yourself to make money is seriously mismatched. And I think investors who are considering
any capital intensive, sickle business, not merely commodities, not merely golden silver,
need to review that list and need to take stock of their own adherence to what they need to do
to make money investing. People should have a long time horizons. I wonder what causes the prices
of metals to go up or down because I could, for example, in the case of gold, people say,
gold is rising because foreign central banks are buying. Sure, but they've been doing that for
10 to 15 years. And the huge surge in gold prices didn't happen until the past 18 months.
Likewise, in silver, there's a shortage. Yes, but the silver has been happening,
shortages have been happening for five years. And I know in copper, people are forecasting the
shortage that I'm sure is eventually going to happen. But I, you know, price copper has done well
for sure, but they're just, I don't think, you know, it's not a huge shortage in the current numbers.
So what actually causes the bull market to start because these narratives, the premise can be
true for a long time without you seeing it in the price. And likewise, the price could continue
going up long after the premise is no longer mature. The last part's important. Market
markets overshoot to the upside and the downside given that the market participants are naive
given that they pay attention and narrative not fact. Market's turned to overshoot to the upside
and they tend to overshoot to the downside. Don't be looking for the markets to get to a equilibrium.
That doesn't happen. A reversion to mean doesn't happen. An overshoot always happens. The mean is
established by overshooting and undershooting over time. In terms of, as an example, the market's response,
because markets in the near-term aren't rational. It's important to note, in the near-term markets
are not to quote Warren Buffett weighing machines. They're voting machines. They're beauty
contexts. They're always at anyone point in time, wrong. A bear market generates a lot of
supply and it takes a while for the changing in narrative to allow the buyers to absorb that excess
supply. The circumstance that was in front of us in 2025 that caused the gold price to move was
there in 2018. But in 2018, people were informed by the prior 40 years market, which is very
benign. So they ignored all of the warning signs. It took five or six years for people to react to the
narrative enough that gold began to get momentum. When gold got momentum, the price action in
gold is a consequence of the momentum verified the narrative for the people who paid attention to it,
but wouldn't accord value to it until ironically the price went up. It has never ceased to
amuse me that I can pound the pole pit all day long to get people to buy silver at $20 an
ounce and they do it till silver is at 60. When the price of silver is up two or threefold and I
sell some, the same people who refused to buy it 20, call me an idiot for selling it at 75.
It's precisely that idiocy, which is say buying low and selling high, that has been responsible
for whatever success I've enjoyed while I feel sorry for people whose technique is the opposite
buying high and selling low, I need to acknowledge the contribution to those people who've made
to mine networks. You were public that you sold roughly 80% of your silver in mid to late January,
and with some of those proceeds put it into silver minors, I've looked at price and silver minors
have actually outperformed the precious metal silver commodity since then, what motivated that call
and tell us about your philosophy for expressing a bullish view or bears view on commodities in
minors versus, I mean, the royalty companies versus the underlying commodity and how that view
may be a change depending on where you are in the bull bear cycle. I, uh, in discussions like this,
view commodities is subjects with my own money, I view them very differently. They have a place
in my own portfolio, and I think people need to do that themselves. They need to think about
these things not in abstract, but rather as to how they impact their family's fortune.
I own gold as a savings asset. I have, in fact, denominated my life in gold since the year 2000.
I mean, maintain liquidity in the U.S. dollar, but I save in gold. And my gold is not for the
foreseeable future for sale. Silver was a very different asset class for me. Silver was a speculative
asset class, and I bought silver because it was hated. I bought silver at $20 an ounce because
I theorized that when the hatred around silver dissipated, that the silver price would move. I noted
two in three prior precious metals bull markets in my life, that precious metals bull markets are
led by gold. They're led by the fear buyer. And when the momentum in the gold price attracts
a generalist investors into the precious metal space, leadership, price leadership changes from
gold to silver. I thought that would occur. The consequence of that is that I made myself a metal note
that I needed to begin to look at silver when silver crossed $50. The idea being that that would be
a marker that the hatred about silver had disappeared. When the reason that I own silver disappeared,
the silver had to disappear, had to disappear too. I let I could think of some other pieces for
keeping it. When I decided that I would sell my silver because it's utility to my portfolio was
then I needed to do what I would decide what I would do with the proceeds. And what I convinced
myself fairly easily was that if the silver, if silver maintained its $75 price for 12 months,
by definition, I wouldn't make any more money on silver. If it just maintained for 12 months,
I'd make no money. But if silver maintained its value of $75 for 12 months, the silver stocks
whose net present value was calculated using a 40 or $45 silver price could increase by 50%.
So from a speculative point of view, I had my choice between an investment that might break even
versus one that would go up 50% and ironically, a situation where if the price of the commodity
was to decline from $75 to $50, would have no impact on the underlying value of the silver stocks.
Maybe in price it would, but not value. So I allocated about half the money that I received
after tax, the tax of sadly were substantial. On my silver portfolio into the silver stocks,
thus far, the silver stocks with one exception have done well and silver has, as I suspected it
might, traded after volatility sideways. And how has the price action and everything you've
observed over the past month impacted your views since then? In May, the general use you sold silver,
rotated into silver stocks since then, have your views evolved at all. As soon as AI tools
begin to wow the world, investors started asking, when will AI driven strategies become more common?
The answer is that they're already here sophisticated quant hedge funds have been using
machine learning strategies for many years, largely only for the benefit of institutional
investors paying higher fees. Now, with the barriers to usage coming down, AI machine learning
approaches are being made available to you through products like depicta, AI enhanced, international
equity ETF, ticker, PQNT. Pquant gives investors enhanced international returns in a low-cost
tax-efficient wrapper, using AI to take advantage of the types of hidden out-performance potential
that human beings may not be able to detect or explain. An unlike many other active ETFs,
Pquant isn't just taking factor risk, leaving you overexposed to specific sectors and betas
or style exposures. Instead, Pquant helps neutralize factor exposure to minimize index tracking air.
That means when it outperforms, it's coming from true idiosyncratic stock returns,
not excessive risk or factor exposure. To learn more about how you can harness the power of AI

Not at all, volatility's noise, but that's all it is. If you're a trader, it's an opportunity.
I'm not a trader. I'm a position player. I believe that over 10 years the U.S. dollar will
lose 75% of its purchasing power, and that gold will in some way shape or form mirror that,
and that silver will outperform gold. That's over the 10-year timeframe. I believe that they both
used up most of the stored energy as a consequence of their failure to perform over five years.
And I looked at that. The perturbations in the price, which is to say $60 to $110 to $70,
well, those moves are dramatic. They're noise. I learned in my life that hyperbolic charts
like the silver price in the last two weeks of December, and all of January, hyperbolic moves,
which absolutely, enthralled speculators are very dangerous. 95% of the time in my life that I've
seen in a hyperbolic chart with the Canadian's call a hockey stick chart. I've noted that the back
side of that chart is just as steep as the front side, but it's a lot less fun if you happen to be
long. Whenever I see a hyperbolic chart in an asset class, I'm long. There's a high probability that
I will sell. Similarly, whenever I see an unexplained hyperbolic chart to the downside,
there's a high probability that I will buy. Most people, mercifully for me,
because I don't like company, think about things exactly the other way. The hyperbolic upside
justifies the narrative that they've come to believe. And when the price of silver goes from
20 to 60 or 70, they intend to buy more as opposed to sell. That's opposite the way I think.
Thank you, Rick. To tell me about your view on the various precious metal royalty companies
like Freckonavato or Wheaton Precious, and how they differ from mining companies.
I love the royalty and streaming business. And I love it because of its predictability.
At heart, I'm a lender and return of capital is more important to me than return on capital.
In the royalty and streaming business, to some extent, after G&A, your grosses your net,
which is to say, you aren't liable for the upfront capital expense of building a money,
you aren't responsible for the sustaining capital expense or the operating expense. That's a very good deal,
which means that one needs to concern oneself with the revenue line as opposed to the
cost line. Pretty good deal. Because of the superior business model, it attracts superior business
people. When I look at the median quality of managers and the royalty and streaming business,
and I compare them to the median quality of managers and promoters in the mining business,
what I see is that a better business attracts better people. So I got a better people, I got
a better business, and I got more predictability, and I got less risk. It's hard for me to figure
out what I might not like about this. A couple of observations based on current commodity
prices, and based on the net present value, in an arithmetically forecastable time frame,
the royalty and streaming companies are expensive. That neglects a couple things. First of all,
they deserve to be expensive because they're better businesses, but importantly,
it doesn't take into account the fact that on very long live assets, 30 or 40 year long
live assets, the net present value calculation repeats itself, which is to say at an 8% discount,
the net present value of a deposit's free cash flows used up in eight or nine years. But eight
or nine years from now, the net present value of that deposit will be the same as it is today. And
when people value royalty and streaming companies, they neglect to value the net present value
tail, which is a huge mistake, an enormous mistake. The second thing is that on the high quality
assets, the very long live assets, the mining companies tend to put those assets in production,
as soon as they've drilled off enough reserve and resource, to amortize the capital expense in
gen of generated 25% annual intern rate of return. What that means is that once a deposit gets 11 or
12 years of reserves, they put it in production, those deposits often have 30 or 35 years
of reserve and resource, which doesn't show up until subsequent drilling. The mining company pays
for that subsequent drilling, but the royalty and streaming companies get the benefit. So you see
deposits like Franco Nevada's Carlin trend deposits, which have now generated well over three
billion dollars for Franco Nevada, but their reserves and resources are higher today than when they
bought the royalties. Talk about the gift that keeps on giving, the knock that Wall Street and
Bay Street had on the royalty and streaming companies three years ago, was that the transactions
that they that built those companies were unavailable today, that the large transactions were
a thing of the past. Yesterday's announcement by Wheaton Precious, that they signed a $4.3 billion
stream, the largest streaming deal in history, puts light at that, and here's why. The copper industry
by itself, according to itself, needs to invest at least $250 billion dollars. That's B,
billion dollars over the next 10 years, to maintain copper production at its current level.
Currently, there's a supply deficit and currently demand for copper is increasing the 2.5%
compounded. To maintain only today's deficit, they need to invest $250 billion dollars,
which is about 150 billion dollars more than the left from free cash flow. This is an
insurmountably large amount of money. That's the first part of the equation. So remember that part.
The second part is that if you take the buy product gold and silver production from these copper
mines, it's substantial. If that free cash flow reports to an integrated minor major mining company,
it's priced by the market between five and seven times cash flow. It's lumped in with copper cash flows.
If it's segregated in a streaming company into a high margin focused product, gold or silver product,
that cash flow trades at 15 to 17 times cash flow. The royalty and streaming companies have a
permanently lower cost of capital. That means that when you are constructing a big copper mine,
if rather than produce out the gold and silver and run a three-year-old income stream,
let's say six times cash flow, you can sell it to a streaming company who gets to value it
16 or 17 times cash flow. They can pay you more for it than you can pay for it yourself.
A four billion dollar transaction between wheat and precious and BHP is simultaneously
advantageous to BHP and wheat and precious. Big transactions in the streaming business
rather than being behind us are going to be in front of us. The streaming business will allocate
more capital in the next 10 years than they've allocated in the last 40. And that's something
that Wall Street and Bay Street haven't yet realized. I think they'll realize it very quickly
as a consequence of yesterday's announcement. But it's a theme that we've been active on for the
last two years. I did not know that about Wheaton's new deal as an investor and fan of Wheaton
myself, that is very interesting news. So for our audience who's not familiar, that the big point
is that these streaming and royalty companies don't have to put up the capital to do new mining
and that the issues that some mining companies have of the fact that
every thing that they drill out of the ground, that's a depletion on their asset. And they
have to spend money to find new resources, not an issue really for the streaming and royalty
companies. When you reference the big assets that kind of made this industry, I think you're referring
to the large copper deals like Antimina, Salobo basically these copper miners and other
other producers, they sell the gold and silver streams to these companies. And these are big,
big mines. When you said the Carlin trend, I'm sure that the rate of return on
Franklin about his Carlin trend is ridiculously high because they got these assets for a song,
like pennies, pennies, I'm sure. But I don't think that it's huge in terms of like
Franco's biggest type of thing. Are you seeing that the big checks that are going to be written
are going to be on these, you know, these massive mines and is with what a shape the sector. And
then I also can ask you what what's your outlook on the smaller players, triple flag,
oh, our royalties, but you're growing. And as well as the the juniors streamers that are much,
much, much time here. The need for capital going to the next 10 years in the mining business is going
to be so so large that I would estimate the demand for streams to be somewhere between $40 and $50
billion. That means that there's plenty of room for wheat and plenty of room for Franco,
plenty of room for Ocisco, plenty of room for triple flag. These facilities are going to have to
syndicate it. Wheaton yesterday used up 80% of its firepower. The next $4 billion deal
that comes along, Wheaton will be able to take a billion of it and there's going to be $3 billion
left over to share. There's going to be something for everybody, everybody. It's important to note
two that as you go down the market cap and quality trail, the net asset value multiple shrink
at the commodity prices that existed a year and a half ago, which are still how mining companies
are valued. Wheaton and Franco are assuming the tail discount, which is to say the market doesn't
take into account the tail discount. We're priced at 1.82 times net asset value. The intermediate
term companies, the ORs, the triple flags, were priced more like 1.4 times net asset value.
And the juniors, the elementals, the voxans, were priced at about 9. What that means is that either
the valuation arbitrage gets bought away by people like me, sophisticated regulators or the big
companies take over the small companies. There's no other choices. It's a very, very, very
benign circumstance. The amount of capital that needs to be allocated in the next 10 years
will exceed the conventional resources of even the big players and they will be forced in syndication
to share those deals with the smaller players at the same time that the valuation discrepancies will
begin to become eliminated. I think two, the emergence of tether on the scene as an important
shareholders and example in gold royalty and elemental is important two different ways. The first thing
is that the smaller royalty companies, elemental in particular, are going to be able to offer their
dividends to shareholders in gold, through tether. A lot of people who own gold stocks or people
who believe in gold and they would probably prefer to get their dividend in species as it wants to
in cash. I think this will attract the market's attention. The second thing is that tether has expressed
interest in the fact that the small royalty companies trade into substantial discount to larger
companies largely because of their size. What that means is that if you merge for the three or four
or five small companies into a mid-sized company by that simple act, you eliminate a lot of
the valuation discrepancy. So I think that you're going to see if the value arbitrageers don't
flatten out the valuation discrepancies. You will see takeover of smaller companies by larger companies
and you'll see horizontal amalgamations among smaller companies, all of which benefit the share
over. The third thing you're going to see is you're going to see extraordinarily attractive
bond issuance by the royalty and streaming companies. You will see the traditional long bond holders,
the 20 or 30 year bond holders, the people who need stable yield over 30 years, the pension funds
the university dominance, begin to disintegrate out of US dollar bonds and begin to acquire bonds
that may pay dollars but are denominated subway shape or form in gold. It wouldn't surprise me to see
wheat and precious or Franco issue a 30 year bond with a sort of a three or three and a half handle.
If you are employing capital that costs you three and a half or four and you are deploying
that capital at nine or ten or twelve, the returns on capital when you're enjoying a 600 basis
point spread between your cost of funds and your return on capital employed does wonderful things
to goose your equity. Wow, so you think I would those companies be issuing bonds that are
payable in gold or payable in dollars that you'll peg to a certain gold price. In other words,
a modern-day gold standard? I think there's enough flexibility in the futures market that they could
issue a bond which is denominated in dollars but has some form of synthetic gold coal and I think
their ability to engineer that product, we engineer those products of battlebank all the time.
The ability to engineer that product assuming that their nominal cost of capital was three and a half
their total cost of capital after the hedge would probably be 4.14.2 percent and importantly,
that's a hedge that is probably not duplicable by the institutional investor who would buy the bond.
In other words, the only way to get that, the only easy way to get that would be to buy the bond.
I think a second thing that will occur is that credit products will be developed
that will allow gold and silver companies now that there's demand for their dividends to be paid
in gold or silver for them to keep increasing amounts of their working capital in gold and silver
rather than in dollars. My own bank, battlebank, is working on products right now that would
allow gold companies to keep most of their working capital, most of their liquidity in gold,
and established credit lines against that gold that would allow them to use the gold and silver
without selling it to meet their working capital leads. I think the shareholders of gold and silver
companies will love this, many of them will at least. A lot of the people who own gold and silver
mining companies own them because they think the gold and silver price will do well and they don't
want to see their companies hold their liquidity or pay their dividends in dollars for serving
rather that the financial operations of the companies be denominated in gold and silver
as opposed to in dollars and all of this is coming quickly.
Really interesting you say that about elemental it was formally known as EMAX that it did a merger
and for people listening at home yes Rick was referring to Tether the largest stablecoin
issuer that is an investor in a lot of these these projects is elemental one of your favorite
royalty companies and what did you think of of the deal the merger. I love the deal. I was a founding
shareholder of altus which became elemental elemental altus and I was a founding shareholder VMAX.
So I've been in this trade doubt 22 years I better love it. Joining the two companies was unique
in many ways. First of all by joining the two companies making the larger and creating increasing
their trading liquidity over the course of the year you raise the share price and lower the cost of
in particular because the combined companies current size is such that they are becoming a must buy
to index funds and ETFs. We expect that as much as 15% of the share register of the new elemental
royalty will transfer over the next 12 months from active buyers to passive ETFs. That makes the
share price go up. There is an obvious seller but there's a very obvious buyer that's very attractive.
The second thing is that you eliminate the duplicate overheads between the two companies. You don't
need to CFOs. There's probably three or four million dollars in administrative savings the
reports of the bottom line immediately the combined company has the stature that it can enter into
conventional as opposed to unconventional debt agreements. When EMAX used to have to borrow money
before they got a banking arrangement they had to go to a guy named Rick rule. He was always available.
He was never cheap. I suspect that any rational mining company would prefer to go to the Royal
Bank of Canada or the Wandamark to Rick rule to Rick rules hobbyists. Shagrin that has
an advantage too but there's one more synergy the elemental side of the transaction
I would suggest had more capital market sophistication than the EMAX side but the EMAX side had
better technical intelligence. They generated their own royalties through exploration efforts
and they were able to identify royalties that were sale off market because they came from the
mining community. This merger of these two talents, the ability to access royalty transactions or
create them organically and the ability to utilize that in capital markets more efficiently creates
a very, very, very powerful nuclear. The CEO from EMAX who took over he's the one with the
technical ability who's discovered all the deal and also elemental has copper exposure
not just precious metals. EMAX has debt deep copper exploration experience.
There is within the EMAX royalty portfolio a lot of copper exposure. The only copper exposure that
EMAX has currently paying the portfolio is from the spectacular Serbian discovery
now operated by Zgin. The generated royalty that EMAX has is a royalty on the enormous Zgin deposit
at Bohr in Serbia and as Zgin gets deeper down into the buried poor free copper becomes an
more important part of the EMAX royalty package organically. Elemental bought their royalty. Ironically
on Caster will not ironically. The EMAX guys, the elemental guys knew each other and the Casterronis
royalty sale exceeded the ability for either company to do on their own. So they did it together
as they became as they got to know each other. They became more together than they had originally
been. But copper will be an increasingly important part of that royalty story anyway.
Another royalty company that comes to mind with regards to copper exposure to the Earth that
many is Altias. Altias is a wonderful company. I don't think of them as a royalty company so much as
I consider them to be an asset allocator in the National Resources Business. I believe
I was Altias shareholder number five very early on. Brian Dalton who is the person who attracted
me to the company then. In those days I think of my memory serves me well at 24 or 25 year old
geologist and laborer is now a seasoned mining executive. It means one of the best asset
allocators, one of the best capital allocators in the resource space. He was attracted to the
royalty business early on and completed some royalty transactions. Voices, bay being one, but the
Canadian Pacific land package, being two, that were acquired very early in his career and before
royalty transactions began to attract as much competition as they have now. Brian was very early on
understanding that his cold royalty in Alberta would cease to pay given political correctness in Canada
and he was early in understanding that he'd be used those cold co-payments to do royalty and
streaming deals in alternative energy and wind and solar that the wind and solar royalties
would attract the premium in the market. He's made his shareholders. I would suggest $150
million in that present value on that bet. I don't know that I would regard them as a royalty and
streaming company so much as I would argue that they are a natural resources merchant bank.
With the focus on royalty and streaming, they are just really good, really disciplined investors.
So they just sold, I believe, two-thirds of a giant goal, precious metals, stream to Franco
Nevada and so they'd like to be counter cyclical. So now I think I've heard Brian Dalton say that
problem silver is it's a it's a hot market and he likes to play in the markets that aren't hot
and so that's why he bought lithium royalties where the price of lithium has collapsed over the past
five years and he bought this lithium all these lithium royalties. What did you think of that deal?
I hope he's right. I'm less bullish about the lithium than he is. I love the fact that people hated.
Brian is younger than I. And hence he is probably better at technological adaptation.
I'm terrified that direct lithium extraction will work, that the oil and gas companies will
learn how to extract lithium matter their waste waters. I grew up in the geothermal and oil
gas business thinking lithium was waste. And if X1 chip run an oxidant and mid-American power
can in fact extract lithium from these brines that's going to have profound implications on the
lithium business if they can't then Brian's bets a long ball home run. It's important to note
that what he did was important to lithium business. But given the money that he spent relative to the
money he has available, it's a rounding error to all of this. Tell me why you said it's not a
royalty's business. Brian started off as a prospect generator. And their original royalty creation
was organic. Brian has looked very closely at operating assets. Brian also, although it is
indirectly a royalty that has a large passive holding in Labrador iron, Brian has bought whole
deposits that were out of favor. He at one point in time on the Mingmine. He is not adverse to
doing the transactions that are non royalty transactions. He is aware that he doesn't have within
the altias wrapper, the type of construction or operating expertise that would be required outside
royalty and streaming. But he's evidence to willingness. He looked very closely at acquiring a package
of hydro assets. He didn't do it as it ended up because he saw higher risk adjusted internal rates of
return in other businesses. But I mean years and years and years ago, in his only business mistake
that I know of, he attempted to organize an oil and gas refinery in Newfoundland that would be
export oriented that would service the European continental market. And he was pretty far along
before he was convinced by the political powers in Newfoundland to try to finance this refinery
domestically as opposed to rely on European financial institutions like British Petroleum.
The consequence of that is that an enormous opportunity to do a shareholder is went away
because he listened to politicians. But the fact that he was willing to take a concept
that needed to be done, dance it with joint venture partners, in a field as disparate as oil and gas
refining, will tell you that he's pretty general in his taste. Now, he was never going to operate
an oil refinery. He was going to put together the political approvals. He was going to put together
the land package. He was going to put together the feasibility study and then he was going to bring
an apartment and his own mind British Petroleum to finance the refinery and operate the refinery
and pay him something that looked suspiciously like a royalty on the refinery output. But the
effect is that it wasn't by any way shape or form a conventional royalty or stream investment.
We've noted out plenty on the royalty business for our audience. Let's talk about the majors in the
mining sector. Looking just at the top 10 gold and silver miners. What do you look for for
qualities that you like? What do you look for for potential red flags or maybe orange flags that
make you a little bit less excited? Right now, I want long live to ask that. I want to pipe
line, too. But I understand that the same inflation that's driving gold and silver prices is driving
up the cost of new construction at operating costs. So, I want long reserve life indexes from
mines that don't need to be permitted or constructed. I want companies that have the majority of
their projects operating in the best cost quartile worldwide, which is to say I want companies
like as an example Agnico Eagle. It'd be in the lowest quartile in terms of all in sustaining
cost worldwide. While simultaneously being for the most part in the best quartile in terms of
return on capital employed, I want companies to have reasonable balance sheets. It is true that you
grow faster employ more debt. It's also true that that makes you much more financially vulnerable.
I think it's important to note that. And I want wherever possible to invest in companies that have
great recycle ratios. Most people don't know what recycle ratio is. So, what do you define it?
For those people who come from sane industries rather than mining. Recycle ratio describes
the amount of reserves and resources that a company can add onto its books either through
development acquisition or exploration. From the margin that they earn from one unit of production.
So, as an example, if Agnico sells an ounce of gold for $5,000 and they're all in cost
and are including depletion tax depreciation is $2500. They earn $2500 from that ounce of gold.
Recycle ratio is how many ounces of gold they can add to their balance sheet with the $2500
that they earn from the sale of an ounce. Recycle ratios of $1.25 or better are sustainable.
After G&A, recycle ratios below that aren't. It's important in considering recycled ratio
that the management team who's existing track record you're buying is still the management team
that's running the company. If there was a management team that was a student and did
wonderful things but they've retired they're no longer with us that you have to discount the
probability that the new management team can emulate the track record of the past. But it's
important nonetheless to look at corporate culture and recycle ratio. There are some other
intangibles that I think are very important. The advantage last year at my own natural resource conference
in Boca Raton, Florida of doing a chat with Amara Aljuni, the new CEO of Agnico Ego.
Worthy to note in the 60 year history of Agnico Ego they've only had three CEO's. That says a lot
to management continuity. And when I was asking him in terms of how he evaluated his company
as competitors, he said one real important factor is employee retention. But what's the average
employee retention? What he says is if you take care of your people, your people take care of
you shareholders. A well-run company has people who love to wear their jerseys. He said lost time
injury is something else that you have to look at. A well-run mind is a clean mind and it's a
safe mind. So well-run businesses have long-standing loyal employees and don't hurt or kill them
and I've begun to employ that in my own securities analysis. I've begun to research statistics
on employee retention and lost time injuries and fatalities, which I think is an increasingly
important metric in my own quiver in determining corporate efficiency. As the price of a gold goes
up, does that cause the recycle ratio to go up as well? Not necessarily. And you need to do
recycle ratio competitively. In other words, you need to compare a company by company, by company,
rather than absolute. I remember very well in the decade of the 80s and 90s,
while I did a lot more oil and gas work than mining work. Looking at all kinds of efficiencies,
measurements of efficiencies, in oil and gas companies, have then associated with my now-retired
Jeff Howard, published something called Petroleum Industry Profiles, where he took the 400
largest oil companies and measured them in various ways in terms of corporate efficiencies.
And I remember in the Gulf of Mexico operating theater that by any of the 14
efficiency metrics that Jeff tracked, the freeport Mac Moran finished one, two, or three in any category.
And if you combined all of the categories, freeport was so far ahead of everybody,
so that there wasn't even a race. That tells you that there are certain
aggregations of human beings, performing certain tasks that are way better than the rest.
And while this might not matter in three months or six months, it matters a lot over 10 years.
It is true that in a market with rapid commodity price increases, that the least efficient
companies do the best. Because if you're a high margin producer, the increase in commodity prices
widenes your margin better than more efficient companies, I'm not an optionality investor anymore.
I used to be, I'll give up a little bit of my upside to optionality. If you take away all of my
downside associated with efficiency, you're saying that in the long run companies that you have
a high quality assets are going to do better. But in the short term, during gold bull market,
such as the one that we've had, the stocks that are going to have done the best are the ones
that had rain in the mine and they had all these issues because they are the ones who benefited
the most from gold going up. A simple bath. Let's take ourselves back to the days when gold
sold for $2,000 an ounce. If you were a hyper-efficient producer, you produce gold for $1,000 an ounce.
If you were an inefficient producer, you produce gold for $2,000. But let's not be that extreme.
You produced it for $1,500 an ounce. So the efficient producer had a $1,000 margin and the
inefficient producer had a $500 margin. If you take the gold price up from $2,000 to $2,500,
the efficient producer's margin is up by 50%. Well, the inefficient produces margin doubles.
I have learned in my declining years that in a gold bull market, the returns I get from the
best of the best are spectacular. The idea now that I chase incremental gains from leverage
at the expense of real operational risk doesn't make any sense to me. I would rather as opposed to
owning a 30 company ETF or 40 company ETF composed of 20 companies that I would otherwise buy.
I would rather have 80% of the performance of the sector by buying the five best companies in the sector.
In other words, I would rather divorce myself from the financial and operating risk of an inefficient
management team, even if it meant that I enjoyed a little less upside in a bull market.
Who are those top five operators in gold and silver? And also of course, I recognize there's
overlap. Well, it doesn't exist in silver necessarily. I would say that the top three mining equity
investments in the world right now would be Franklin Nevada, Wheaton Precious, and Agme Coetal.
If we are lucky enough to see a circumstance where Barrick rather than spinning out the North American
assets combines their North American assets with new West North American assets, then
you would potentially have a fourth-entrant. Barrick, which used to be called Barrick gold and the
ticker used to be gold and not only did they change the ticker from gold, they dropped gold from
the literal name. They were trying to diversify, you know, not their fault, but be given how
gold prices have done. It was not a well-timed decision. You're saying that if Barrick merged with
Newmont or they combined that then you would like it. How come if you, you know, how comes A plus B
equals C, how come you like C more than A and B? Newmont was a collection of tier two assets,
and Newmont decided three years ago after they bought new crest. They made a promise to the
institutional investors that they would no longer be a dog pound. They said that the combined company
had something like 28 mines, and they would sell everything that was material one mine. They told
the market that they would raise $2 billion in these assets sales so far they've raised almost five
with more to come. But more importantly, they don't know any longer distract their management
time and attention with assets that don't matter. They still have assets that are priced at
discount in the market, which is to say assets and jurisdictions that are regarded as politically
gamey like Mexico. And my suspicion is that if they sold those assets and focused on assets
that the market believed were in more politically secured jurisdictions that the market rightly
were wrongly would reward them for that. Similarly, Barrick has difficulties in the market because
a lot of its cash flow comes from West Africa and its growth is in Pakistan. Well, I love the
Pakistani asset. It's what I've known for years. The market hates it. And I suspect that we're
Barrick to sell or spit off their West African assets into a company that would would resemble
say endeavor. And sell the Pakistani assets to Zijin, a Chinese company who would buy them in a
flash. And combine their northern Nevada assets with their joint venture partner, Newmont,
into one company that a company that was the North American assets of Barrick and Newmont
would be on a valuation basis, the most highly rated gold company in the world. If you see what
Agnico Eagles done, what they've done over time is sold off their second tier assets and they
sold off assets that didn't have other assets that they operated nearby. They want to buy assets
that give them leverage and operating synergy for assets that they've already bought. So they have
an incredible concentration of assets as an example in the Amitibi. It is the only place they have
assets. But what you're seeing inside Agnico is a focus on an area that they understand better than
their competitors where they can leverage off assets that they already have in the area. And I suspect
that the performance that Agnico shareholders have enjoyed is a consequence of the 20 year
focus on the Abitibi would be shared by Barrick and Newmont shareholders. If there was a renewed
focus on northern Nevada, buried within Barrick, which most people understand, is a new discovery
called for miles, something they've been working on for five or six years. This is by all
indications a 20 million ounce high grade high quality North American discovery. It's a gold
mine that's conveniently located between two gold mines. It has access to highways,
access to power, access to a good regulatory environment. It's next to a town where gold miners live.
The market would love that discovery in the context of the focus North American producer. By the
way, what I'm talking about likely won't happen. The people who run Newmont want to continue to
run Newmont and the people who run Barrick want to continue to run Barrick. And if you merge
that company, at least one group of incumbents would be allowed to pursue other employment opportunities,
which, you know, for many management teams, true yield is their salaries and their
amoluments. So it's unlikely that this circumstance, which would benefit shareholders greatly,
will occur because it won't benefit the people who, at least, normally make the decisions.
Tell us about that interplay of operational risk and jurisdictional risk. So, you know, if there
are mines in Mexico or Africa that have it all in sustaining cost of $8 or $900, so they have
very high margin mines, are you as an investor less excited about those mines than a mine in America
or Canada that has an all in sustaining cost of $1,314 dollars? Not me, but I'm not the market.
I was a very large shareholder of red gold and exploration, the stock that merged in Debaric,
and the recently departed CEO of Debaric, Mark Bristo is a good friend of mine, and he made me
by my standards a very handsome sum of money building a West African producer. I believe, and I'm
a distinct minority, that every jurisdiction is bad. I don't believe there's a good jurisdiction.
I believe that some jurisdictions are worse than others, but I have found, in my life,
by absorbing the volatility and the psychic disutility of investing in strange countries,
I've enjoyed higher economic rates of return. Most institutional investors don't want to scare
their shareholders like that, and probably they don't want to take the psychological risk themselves.
So my point of view is very unpopular, and there is no doubt that operating in frontier jurisdictions
means that your cost of capital is higher. There's zero doubt about that. Your cost of capital
is higher, both in terms of debt and in terms of equity, and occasionally your brain strain is higher.
Mark Bristo went into Mali when nobody else would, and the consequence of that is that the fiscal
arrangements he made with the government of Mali, while they were extraordinarily beneficial to the
government of Mali at the time, became less beneficial as time went on, and the Mali said,
yes, we understand we have an agreement, and yes, we understand that the jurisdictions that agreement
is Stockholm, and that we need to subject this to international arbitration, and then they said
in their troops, sees the might and stole the gold. I'm using Mali as an example, operating in West
Africa exposes you to a different set of operating challenges. West Africa is in flux,
and an agreement isn't necessarily an agreement. Now, investors who have long memories like
Mali Recruel will remember 20 years ago in place fiscal agreements in Alberta, Canada,
a conservative political jurisdiction known for its fondness for the oil and gas business.
When investments were made in the gas business in Alberta, particularly predicated on a certain
fiscal regime promoted by the Alberta government, and the gas price rose, the Alberta government
retroactively doubled the gas royalty. In other words, they nationalized part of the free cash flow
stream that would otherwise have gone to investors. In other words, Alberta was Mali. When
your money is stolen, and I hate saying this, but for people who look like you and I,
for whatever reason, when your money is stolen by white people in English, according to
the rule of law, it feels less gone than when it's stolen by people in different languages with
different complexions. In truth, the money's just as gone. The worst experience,
Jack that I've ever had with political risk, real experience with political risk,
happened to be in the People's Republic of California. We made a gold discovery called Castle
Mountain, sadly seven miles on the wrong side of the California Nevada line, and our
carpeting took a 13 years longer than it should have. If you assume an 8% discount,
8% cost of funds that the net present value of a deposit is gone after 10, 100% of the net
present value at the time of discovery was lost to the legislation in California. In addition to 13
years of lost cash flow, political approval required 13 million dollars in bribes. No 16, I'm sorry.
These were deficient bribes like in Congo. These were campaign contributions,
deeds in lieu, studies, stuff like that. So 16 million dollars in bribes, because these campaign
contributions would never have been made in a fair political environment. And 13 years of unnecessary
permitting time. In addition to that, there were about to, if my memory serves me well,
and I may be wrong here, about 30 million dollars in environmental offsets. That makes me think of
that offshore project in California. I know investors, some of whom are incredibly intelligent,
got really excited about offshore drilling in California, and I don't know how that's gone.
Well, the guy who's promoting that, Jim Flores, has made a lot of his a lot of money.
And I have to say, Exxon just threw up his hands. They really truly threw up their hands. There
is so much exploration upside in California, onshore, and offshore. And none of it has been exploited
using modern technology because of the California State Legislature. If Flores can pull this off,
I don't know if he can. He bought a couple billion dollars for 60 or 70 million bucks.
It resembles the ornoco in Venezuela. It is absolutely insane. And he bought existing reality to
a huge discount. Now, he has a huge problem. Governor Grusom, the guy who runs the state of
California, has presided over the reduction of California's refinery fleet from 40 to 7.
As a consequence of that, he has engineered the highest gas prices in the state of California.
He is truly an evil whack job. And he's extremely popular in California. I'm an Exxon
of California. I know that there's a huge fondness for evil whack jobs in California. If the voters
note that they can buy gasoline for $2.90 in Nevada as opposed to $6 in California, if they aren't
Tesla owners, they might wonder about the efficacy of Governor Grusom. Right now, ironically,
tankers of oil have been coming from Bahamas through the Panama Canal to land at Long Beach.
It would be much, much, much cheaper to transport that oil from the Huntington field in Long Beach
to Long Beach than from Bahama to Long Beach. The taxpayers and citizens of California
probably need to decide whether what they're doing as efficacious one needs to ask the governor
about the carbon footprint of bringing refined products to California from the Caribbean or the
Atlantic as opposed to bringing them from California to California. One needs to wonder too
with the budget deficit in California, whether or not the tax that California might earn
from its oil and gas industry, might be useful in terms of the out-of-control expenditures
in the people's Republic of California. I'm not saying that this bet that Florida's made
is going to win. I'm saying he is a truly superior human being and he has taken a monumental bet
and if he pulls it off, it will dwarf the incredible amount of money he made for
those of us who backed him in the Gulf Coast. Was that a publicly traded stock? Well, what was the
Gulf Coast deal? Flores and rucks. They built a company by buying under-utilized assets that the
majors had tuning them up and eventually sold it. He's a superhuman being. I got a question about
oil and gas, but just real quick, I know in the mining business you love high-quality assets
and not assets that are non-producing, but there are two non-producing assets that I imagine some
people watching would want your opinion on. The first would be high-croft, a silver mine,
non-producing, but the second would be snowline the gold project. At one point in time, it's a
creditor. I owned 100% of high-croft. So I know it reasonably well. We put it into a company called
Vista and Vista during that last period of optionality did extraordinarily well. It was a 20
bagger. I'll be it from a very low-start. At that point in time, there were probably 15 million
contained out since 12 or 15 million ounces of high-croft, but very, very low-grade. And every time
I'd fly over that deposit, I'd see that alteration package, which is one of the biggest alteration
packages in Northern Nevada. And I thought, on my own, it's impossible that you could put in place
12 to 15 million ounces of low-grade deposit without some faulting or some ground penetration
that would allow higher-grade pockets, a million or a million and a half ounce pockets of high-grade.
And there were some intriguing hits, you know, half ounce hits, three-quarter ounce hits,
there were some high-grade silver hits, 20 ounce silver hits. When we spun high-croft out of Vista
into Allied Nevada, we put in place a wonderful guy who had built Kid Ross. But Buck and P spent
probably a hundred million dollars. Look at those high-grade packages and we never found them.
There's a sea of low-grade sulfides there. To exploit those sulfides, you're going to have to roast it
or you're going to have to run it through a retort. I think it probably works at $5,000.
I don't have the guts to own it any longer. I've owned parts of that deposit four times in my life
and I've made a lot of money on that four times in my life. I'm too afraid to go the fifth time.
Eric Sprott, who is a better speculator than I hit. You measure his worth against mine,
you'll see which of the two of us is smarter, is a very large shareholder there. He believes
that technology will play a role that if you bet against technology lower in costs with a
prize that's that large that you're stupid. He's probably right, I'm probably stupid. And he also
believes that $5,000 is just to start. He is willing to play the marginality game. I was willing
to play it too in the early part of the decade of the 90s. When I go back then, there was no expectation
in the market that commodity prices would ever rise. And we were able to build companies,
well, two of them, Pan American silver and silver standard, by buying silver deposits for
five cents and ounce that were unaconomic at $5,000 silver, but would be economic at $15 silver.
There was no cover charge if you will, because there was no expectation that commodity prices
would ever rise. That's all changed now. You have to pay up for optionality. I loved optionality
when I got it for free. And Snowline? I love Snowline. Lots wrong with it. It's in the middle of
nowhere, really truly in the middle of nowhere. In fact, it's a long way for nowhere, but it's a huge
deposit. I think it's a district. I think it's a series of deposits. And in addition to being huge,
it's high-grade. They have done a reasonably good job with a local community. Something that hasn't
always been true in Northern Canada. They have interacted with indigenous people since the very
beginning of the discovery. And they have done, I think, a pretty good job training people
that didn't have the sophistication to work on site and brought them on site. There will be
infrastructure challenges getting in there. I've been there. I mean, it is a long helicopter
flight from nowhere, but the size of the price is too huge. I believe line of sight to 10 million
ounces. And I believe when history is written, there's probably 20 million ounces there.
They're high quality ounces. The government of Yucan is solidly on their side, the local citizen
is solidly on their side. The people who are running the company have been thus far remarkably stingy
in terms of DNA, which is, say, has been a well-run company. A company has been run for the
butt-of-bit instead of shareholders. A transaction will not happen quickly there,
because the people in the industry who will who will acquire this project are going to allow
the current team to deriske it. They're going to allow the current team to do the
environmental baseline studies, to do the sociological studies, to run through permitting
to continue to spend tens of millions dollars a year drilling it off. But at some point in time,
this deposit will be bought. And it will be bought by a new mod or an agnico-eagle. And it'll
be bought for an eye-popping multiple. This will become a must-own deposit.
While we're talking about non-producing assets, Rick, I posted something, I believe,
probably about wheat and precious metals or some of something. This company, I'll tell you
what is it in a moment. And he said, this company is run by a man in his 80s, and he's been
doing this for so long. And then I looked up the revenue of the company. The revenue was
very close to zero. And I said, oh, this is, now past, you know, then I looked into the company,
and I, you know, I'm not a shareholder right now, but it did seem a little interesting.
What do you think about Globex? I'm a fairly large Globex shareholder. Okay. And I know the gentleman
to who you, for sure. First of all, he's much more like the chairman now. The chief operating officer
is a much younger guy. But I've known struck for four decades. He's one of the few guys in the
business is older than me. I joke with him that, you know, he's exploring in two billion-year-old
rock packages in Northern Quebec and Ontario. And he's a contemporary of those packages. He's a
very good guy. It's a collection of assets that hasn't been able to be advanced because there wasn't
the money available to explore. That's all changed. The whole industry is looking for exploration
projects that are drill ready. And he has a 20-year inventory. It's as though he has a drill ready store
and there's a line up of customers ready to come in. There's a huge, huge, huge royalty inventory
in there. But because Globex isn't viewed as a royalty company, it hasn't enjoyed the royalty
multiple. Now, make no mistake. I'm a large shareholder there. So what you hear from me is a biased
long, and people who don't have the courage to own $700 million market caps, people who don't
have a five-year horizon to see value unlocked, should not own Globex. But if you're a speculator,
that's a very different circumstance. Let's now turn to oil. Looking at a Canadian royalty
place, I believe there are only three. There's Prairie Sky freehold and then Topaz. How do you
evaluate them versus their Canadian drilling counterparts of actual producers, as well as their
perhaps much more doded upon brethren in the Permian Basin, which that's where a lot of the action
has been. I own all three of the Canadians, and I own two of the Permian Basin ones. The Canadian
ones are selling at half the real cops. I like stuff that's cheap. It's all of that reduction for
a reason. He has an aim. He's the Prime Minister of Canada, Carney. He has a spoused fiscal
pragmatism, but he said that his financial decisions will be predicated against carbon,
which tells you a lot. He ran you'll recall in a platform for change, although his government
ran the company for the country for 10 years. And I argue they didn't change. I just argued
that they didn't get it. But I think that the opportunity in Canadian oil and gas is bigger than
the political obstacle. I may be wrong. What sets the Western Canadian sedimentary basin apart
from its U.S. counterpart is that as a consequence of better capital markets and better politics
in the U.S., the U.S. has much more thoroughly drilled. It is arguable that 85% of the current tier
one locations in the Permian Basin at $60 oil have been drilled, which means that the underworld
inventory is about 15% of the original. The similar number in Canada is about 45% has been drilled,
so it's much, much, much less drilled. The upside at today's commodity prices is assuming that the
politics begins to repress itself. It's much better in Canada, although the Canadian companies are selling
at much, much, much lower multiples. Of the Canadian royalty companies, my favorite based on
corporate culture, and my favorite on general administrative expense relative to AUM or free cash flow,
is freehold. There's small. They're becoming a little less efficient as they diversify their royalty
holdings outside of Canada and the United States. They are buying assets in competition with
companies that have lower cost of capital. Prairie's guy traditionally hasn't been as efficient
to an allocator of capital, but they have a treasure trove assets. I mean, a real treasure trove.
Topaz has been financially the most efficient, and it is as a consequence relative to its
fundamentals probably the most expensive. I think that the Canadian mid tier, the sort of
$5 billion to $10 billion market cap companies, are uniformly more attractive than their American
counterparts. And as a consequence of that, while I have almost no American mid-cap companies,
I own a reasonable number of the Canadians, because of the incredible upside they have both
on a valuation basis, but much more particularly on an underordered inventory basis.
I haven't been buying oil stocks for the last three months, because all of the price
performance, I hope to enjoy over two years. I've enjoyed the last three months.
I love Dex on a year ago, by love it at $100. There's less to love at $160 that there was
at $100. Ironically, more people want to buy it for $160 to buy it for $100, which is
across, I guess I'll just have to bear. I suspect that oil and gas quotes, which I think are inflated
as consequence of Iran, and perhaps Russia, will decline, and I'll get a second kick at the can.
I don't know that that'll happen. I can be patient, because I don't want all this stuff,
but I love the sector over the five-year timeframe. Final question. Tell us just about
the royalty plays that you like in the Permian Basin and why. I'm not buying them, so I'd prefer
not to do that. I would like to do is say to anybody who cares about my resource picks,
