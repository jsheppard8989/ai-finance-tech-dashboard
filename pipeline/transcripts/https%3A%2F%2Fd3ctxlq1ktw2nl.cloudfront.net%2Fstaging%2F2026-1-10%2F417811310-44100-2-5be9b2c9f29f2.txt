You're welcome back to another episode of The Jack Malers Show.
I am your host, Jack, and you are tuning in to yet another episode of Mailbag Monday
Ladies and Gentlemen episode 104.
The title of today's episode is from Software to Hardware.
Excuse me, from Software to Hard Asset, Bitcoin and the new liquidity regime.
Before we get started, let me, time, stamp this episode.
Right, remember, robot voice.
What's the guy's name, Bruce Buffer?
Is that his name?
Bruce Buffer.
Yeah.
Let's do my Bruce Buffer impersonation for Bitcoin price.
With the Bitcoin price sitting at $70,440 US dollars in a market capitalization of $1.41 trillion.
$44.2% down from its all-time high of $126,160.
Set on October 6, 2025, 126 days out.
At a Bitcoin block, kind of $935,818.
We have the Orange Coin this day.
Humble and Stacks.
That's Bitcoin!
Bit of a price dip.
I'm clocking into you guys at a little over $70,000 per Bitcoin $1.41 trillion asset class in size.
Bitcoin block mine was Bitcoin block height 935,818.
The title from software to hard asset, Bitcoin and the new liquidity regime.
Without further ado, let's get started.
Okay, here's my thesis for today's episode.
So, Bitcoin took a beating.
It was one of the worst days ever recorded in Bitcoin's history.
I've talked to you guys about the infamous COVID day.
When we were down 50-50% in one day.
This felt similar.
There was definitely a slaughterhouse.
I mean, Bitcoin fell.
I think it was 20% in a day, which for a multi trillion dollar asset is quite the drop.
That is intense.
It was a crazy day across both companies.
And so trying to understand what is going on.
Why did Bitcoin fall?
What does it have to do with broader macro economics?
I believe very fundamentally that Bitcoin is a macro asset.
In fact, it may be the most true and freely tradeable macro asset that the world has access to.
So, over the weekend, I took a deep dive and did a little bit of research and kind of came up with
what I think is a really inspiring thesis.
So, I put together a tweet storm that basically uses this episode in tweet form.
So, if you haven't checked it out, go check it out.
But this is the thesis.
I wrote, Bitcoiners have long viewed Bitcoin as the solution to currency decline.
It's better gold.
It's the ultimate money.
Instead, the broader market has treated it like a software stock.
Painful.
But this dip may be how Bitcoin stops trading like tech and starts trading like a hard asset.
So, my thesis is, you know, unfortunately, although Bitcoin is the only fixed supply money in the history of mankind.
Right?
Although, Bitcoin's the best money we've ever invented, properties like divisibility, portability, how easy it is to soar.
Celebrity and liquidity.
It's ability to transcend borders.
It's monetary policy.
Everything about Bitcoin is pound for pound better than fiat better than gold.
Better than anything you can own.
But weirdly, Bitcoin has traded almost like a technology stock, like a software stock.
And so, I think that this dip has a lot to do with the software stock piece.
People complaining my volume is low.
Okay. What about now?
Sorry about that.
Not a professional podcaster.
So, where was I?
Oh, okay.
I think this dip has a lot to do with Bitcoin's weird relationship with software technology.
And I actually think that this dip is going to be really healthy for Bitcoin in the long term,
because inevitably, at some point, we're going to have to resolve of the fact that Bitcoin is trading like a tech stock.
And it's not a tech stock.
It's the best money in human history.
And so, at some point, we're going to have to grow out of that as an asset class.
And we're going to have to mature through that.
And I actually think that that might be happening right now.
And I'll be at painful.
Absolutely necessary.
Every dip is good for the longer cause of Bitcoin becoming the best money of all time.
So, without further ado, let's get started.
Chapter one.
Bitcoin isn't trading like gold.
It's trading like software.
We've talked about this before.
Bitcoin's correlation to gold is 0.09, meaning effectively zero correlation.
They've never moved at the same time.
But what Bitcoin does seem to be highly correlated with in what it is trading like is software technology stocks.
So, first of all, why is Bitcoin dumping?
What are people missing?
I'm here to make the case that liquidity, I call it relocating.
And we'll dig into what that means and why.
But a lot of the capital, at least in the United States, but also globally, is leaving software.
Okay, software is going from being an extremely cash-abundant cash-producing asset.
And it's becoming really capital intensive.
And for that reason, capital is leaving software.
It's not this like cash machine anymore.
In fact, the cat backs of these companies is going through the roof.
You combine that with the fact that the United States of America is trying to incentivize capital
to invest more domestically in infrastructure, in energy, in power, in critical minerals, in defense,
and less in these really frothy tech multiples that have created this massive wealth gap.
You know, the Trump administration has talked about Main Street over Wall Street.
Whether that's true or not, whether you believe them or not, it doesn't really matter.
The point is the Biden administration and the Trump administration, the left and the right,
the blue and the red, the Democrat, the Republican, they're trying to do the same thing.
They're trying to unwind from the post-71 dollar from the US dollars, the world reserve currency.
They're trying to build back US defense capabilities, US infrastructure capabilities, manufacturing capabilities,
build back the middle class.
That is unequivocally what the United States is trying to do.
They have realized that they have an issue.
They have realized they've hollowed out their middle class, hollowed out their defense base,
hollowed out their manufacturing base, and it's caused such a problem, such a reliance on China,
political instability in the country, things like drug overdose, things like suicide rates, things like obesity rates,
metabolic disease, assassination attempts, rivaling the civil war, all of the problems that signal a collapsing empire.
The other thing is just, it's very obvious where the liquidity is going, as I just said.
It's going to capex, it's going to energy, it's going to industry, it's going to defense, it's going to critical minerals,
it's going to all the things I just referenced.
The interesting thing that we'll talk about on the show is why the hell does that mean Bitcoin has to take a clobbering.
Right, that's, to me, that's kind of what I figured the most valuable thing I can do for the episode today is
walk you guys through. Well, why is Bitcoin caught in the middle of all that?
Bitcoin's supposed to be like, gold, Bitcoin's a hard asset. Why is Bitcoin getting clobbered like software,
as that's rotating into critical minerals? That doesn't make any sense.
Okay, well, first of all, you know, a picture's worth a thousand words, so for those watching,
in the orange is the Bitcoin price in the white is the software ETF.
So software stock ETFs, and the point is they're one for one.
They're moving the exact same, and this is from 2025 up until today.
So this is not over the last few days, few weeks, few months, this is over the last year.
Okay, for those listening, I think I just described it, but I know a lot of you guys are listening and not watching on YouTube.
The correlation between which I'll show in a second, a tech and Bitcoin is above point eight,
where one is directly correlated, they move to the pixel the same.
Okay, so importantly, what does this mean?
Correlation, specifically in this instance as well, tells us who owns these assets,
tells us the asset owners are the same.
Okay, so the point that I need you guys to understand is, despite us Bitcoiners,
this little nerdy corner of the internet that is finding themselves listening to me live every Monday,
we know in we hold Bitcoin as hard money.
Take me as an example.
I work for Bitcoin. My paycheck gets swept into Bitcoin. I save in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin to me is not a software tech stock.
Bitcoin to me, I'm monetizing Bitcoin. I'm using it to save.
I'm using it to then later exchange for the things I need in my life.
So I'm using Bitcoin as hard money, as hard asset.
Okay, I'm monetizing it.
Now, what about other people? What about the broader market?
The broader market, unfortunately, has viewed Bitcoin as monetary software,
like a software stock.
And you can see this now in the correlation of the software ETF in Bitcoin.
As software has gotten clobbered, that means software is delivering.
That means people are taking capital out and rotating it into other things.
Bitcoin has gotten clumped into that.
So this is very obvious proof that a decent chunk of Bitcoin holders,
a non-zero, a material chunk of Bitcoin holders,
have historically also been these software holders, okay?
So despite how much we want to believe it on our corner of the internet,
that Bitcoin is held by toddlers of last resort,
and we all are never going to sell, and we're all like Michael Seeler,
this correlation chart shows that that's not necessarily true.
And to be honest, I actually started to notice this pattern about 10 years ago.
The run-up in 2017, we started to see a lot newer entrance.
These were levered hedge funds, levered funds.
That was when I once say Wall Street, like today Wall Street's Larry Fank and a black rock,
and all these guys, not that Wall Street, but fast money Wall Street.
Day traders, levered funds, long-only positions.
That's when I started to see these guys show up.
So this is not recent.
People will say, oh, this is since the ETFs.
No, no, no, no.
This is a product of the system of policy.
When you print so much money, and, you know, as we've talked about,
the coasts of America benefit tremendously from what has been monetary policy
in the United States of the last 40 years,
they go in and they punt software, and software has these crazy multiples.
Bitcoin's got this crazy volatility, so on and so forth.
So back to the liquidity rotation we're living through.
Okay, liquidity is leaving software, equities that are dependent on buybacks.
So a lot of the premium that was placed on stocks like Amazon,
is because Amazon would take the immense amount of cash profit.
They were producing and they would buy back the equity.
And so the premium is justified because they are buying the asset that they're creating demand
with their cash flow, with the asset that I own.
Okay, it's rotating out of momentum and leverage.
So things are delivering tremendously.
And the overall structure of the market, the market structure is changing.
You know, we're slowly shifting out of these passive flows.
Okay, liquidity is finding itself into new capex.
So we'll get into in a second, all of these massive big tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on infrastructure.
It's going into energy, industrials, critical minerals, infrastructure.
What people on TV call the real economy.
Okay, so capital is moving in real time.
I referenced this earlier Bitcoin's correlation to tech stocks is approaching point eight, which is extreme.
And if you look at it through its history, I kind of talked about about a decade ago is when I started to notice this correlation like really starting to hike.
And you can visualize it in this chart.
You know, around COVID, it looks like especially the correlation of tech stocks.
And again, it's a result of what has happened.
Okay, what has happened is when you just print ungodly amounts of money, the incentive is for asset holders to continue to punt assets.
What's been hot in the 2010s was tech Bitcoin for a lot of asset holders got bundled into this software tech category.
As Bitcoiners, we've always said that coins not a company that coins not tech.
Why isn't it trading like gold? Well, because the people owning Bitcoin didn't believe clearly the same things we believe.
They didn't value it like gold. They weren't monetizing it. They weren't using it like hard money.
Bitcoin was allocated in this slash, harsh, posh portfolio of software tech levered hedge funds.
And Bitcoin got caught in the liquidity rotation recently and that's happening as I'm talking.
Because a lot of people that owned Bitcoin didn't own it for the right reasons and they got wrecked.
Okay, so why is software taking a beating? Let's just we have to understand from a macro standpoint.
I'm going to be a little bit rhetorical here, but we got to nail this point.
One, the most important point, the biggest catalyst to what's happening is AI.
AI is changing the economic profile of the software companies.
Meaning, the software companies are going from companies that are producing massive record breaking amounts of cash.
Okay, meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google.
These companies are, I mean, they're historically known for being the most profitable things to ever exist in the course of mankind.
Okay, they have now turned into insanely capital intensive businesses.
They're forward projecting like you're seeing their earnings calls and it's like Amazon CapEx changed from 100 billion to 200 billion doubling their cap expenditures.
Okay, the second reason is structural to the United States.
As I've said, the United States has exported the dollar, exported their jobs, exported their manufacturing base,
exported their defense base.
Being the World Reserve currency, doing no proof of work, the last 20 to 40 years has entirely eroded the country.
And that's not a political statement.
That is a left, right, blue, red, Biden, Trump, doesn't matter how you slice it.
We have all the characteristics of a falling and collapsing empire, and Washington DC is trying to fix it.
One of the ways they're trying to fix it is redirect all of this capital into places that benefit the country's agenda.
The country's agenda are re-industrialize, build back a manufacturing base, bring blue collar jobs back.
Bring back our defense base, reduce our reliance on China, hoard our own critical minerals, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Practically reduce the US dollars roll as the world reserve currency.
Okay, we can the dollar.
Neutral assets go up.
All of these things.
The combination of these two results in software getting its ass kicked.
If these software companies are not immensely profitable cash machines, which then take the cash and give it back to shareholders in what we call stock buybacks,
they don't literally pay out dividends, but they just take the cash by the stock to stock goes up.
That's why you own the stock.
The combination of that and the United States is agenda and where we are in this fourth turning and regime change globally.
Big tech is it's software's changing.
Highly levered, high time preference, software stock punters are getting destroyed and that liquidity is rotating.
Okay, so chapter two is how AI changes the economics of software.
So this all started to really exaggerate and get intense when this anthropic model came out recently.
So this CNN title anthropics new AI tool sends shutters through software stocks.
This was published February 4th.
Stocks slumped on Tuesday, amid nerves about AI disrupting the software industry, and then we all know what happened last week.
After stocks started to tumble, leverage beats up leverage, which beats up leverage, which beats up leverage,
and you get these cascading effects where a simple downward move of liquidity getting punished and leverage getting punished.
The cascades on itself and before you know a Bitcoin is down 25%.
Right.
Now, it's important to note, and this is a small nuance, but I think it's important.
It's not like because people will say, Jack, you're being hypervogue.
Facebook, meta is not dying as a company.
Google is not dying as a company.
I'm not saying that because you guys need to take, you know, my thoughts as they are and they're realistic.
And they're practical.
Okay.
It's not killing software companies.
It's killing the premium.
Okay.
So much of the liquidity was going into these companies trading at 50 to 100 times multiples, like Tesla.
Tesla trades at an insane multiple.
You'll never get paid back if you were to buy that business at its market cap value.
Okay.
It's killing the premium.
The premium is no longer justified.
Okay.
Because the old software model was that these businesses were light on assets.
They didn't have very large capex.
They didn't require a lot of investment to run them.
Extremely high margins.
And they could do buybacks.
They had so much cash.
So high scale, high-tam, high margins, asset-light businesses.
Okay.
Now, in the AI world, that's all changed.
They are high compute, high data center, high spend,
high power, high chip businesses.
There's not that much cash left over.
In fact, many of them are spending more than they earned.
Google just had a hundred year bond sale today.
So the point is when you go from very cash rich and a liquidity profile in the 2010s, where it's just print money, print money, print money.
Assets, assets, assets, tech, tech, tech.
And that's changing.
I've talked about this before.
You know, as humans, I fundamentally believe we are best governed by mother nature.
Okay.
We are a product of the universe.
And the further we get away from being governed by the laws of the universe, like proof of work.
And we're governed by unelected central bankers or politicians in DC.
The worse off society becomes.
And I think, you know, there's very cyclical behavior in humans making a lot of progress,
innovating a lot with new technology.
But then finding themselves straight too far away from the laws of the universe, from mother nature, from being governed by who are meant to be governed by.
And then we kind of like repriced and re-correct back to our norms.
And we're living through that repriced, re-correcting, where we're repricing what's real.
Proof of work is real.
Things like gold are real.
Things like land are real.
Things like critical minerals are real.
Things like the ability to defend yourself in your defense space is real.
Things that aren't real.
Printed pieces of paper.
Hundred-time multiples on businesses.
Like none of that.
That is narnia.
That is dumb.
That is stupid.
Okay.
That is fabricated.
Lot of land.
Okay.
So things like silver, gold, bitcoin, land, critical minerals, energy.
Real things.
Mother nature of things.
All being repriced.
Okay.
So this headline from CNBC.
Tech AI spend maybe approaching 700 billion dollars this year.
But the blow to cash raises red flags.
Again, that's my point.
They are now spending insane amounts of money.
And the red flags raised are the fact that it's going to eat into their cash flow.
Capx number.
Go up.
This is big tax.
Capx growth.
In Q1 of 2023, they spent a little over a hundred billion dollars combined.
They are approaching a trillion dollars projected this year.
That is absolutely insane.
This is, again, guys, this is not a trend.
This is not a fad.
This is a factual regime change we are living through.
Another eye watering capex number.
Amazon sees twenty twenty six capex.
About two hundred billion dollars.
That is well above their estimated one hundred and forty six billion.
Holy moly wild stat of the day.
Amazon has spent more on capex in the last three years.
Then in the previous twenty six years combined.
regime change, guys, AI is changing things.
The world is changing the US dollar as the world reserve currency is fundamentally changing.
We are living through whatever you want to call it.
A fourth turning, whatever you want to call it.
The change is absolutely real.
Here's a fun fact for you.
Amazon has never been cheaper on a PE ratio multiple basis ever.
It's trading at twenty twenty nine times multiple.
That is as cheap as Amazon has ever been ever.
So is the stock price as cheap as it's ever been?
No, that's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying the multiples are going to compress, which is another way of saying the liquidity is going to seek a new home.
This is why software is getting its ass beat.
Market structures are changing.
Real things are being repriced.
Another fun fact, I just found these astonishing.
Google has hit an all time high in profit.
A hundred and thirty two billion dollars of annualized profit.
That is absolutely insane.
This chart is so impressive.
The stock price down.
That's crazy.
The profit is making all time highs and the stock is down.
How is that possible?
Well, the business could be getting stronger.
But the stock could be getting weaker because the multiples are impressing the liquidity is finding a new home.
We're living through a regime change.
So you guys get the point.
We move on to chapter three titled, look out below.
Here comes the pain.
So first of all, the quiet part out loud.
I don't really use LinkedIn.
And when I say, I don't really use it.
I mean, I don't use it at all.
It's funny.
I do have a LinkedIn profile.
So that I can click on links when people send it to me.
Sometimes, look at resumes when we're hiring people.
But it's funny.
Because someone said, there's so many Jack Mallorys spoofs out there on LinkedIn.
You have to show everyone what the real account is.
So my name on LinkedIn is like Jack Mallorys in parentheses.
I'm the CEO of strike.
I don't know.
It's funny.
But anyways, I think LinkedIn is stupid.
But what I found hilarious is Larry think posted on LinkedIn.
And what he said was the quiet part out loud was outrageous.
So you guys can look this up.
I'm sure you know LinkedIn better than me.
But the title of the post from Sir Larry think,
is my remarks as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum
at the 2026 annual meeting in Davos.
Okay.
And on the right, a little bit down in the article,
not too far down in the first section.
I will just read you guys the section quickly.
Titled broadening prosperity.
Prosperity isn't just growth in the aggregate.
It can't be measured by GDP or the market cap of the world's largest companies alone.
It has to be judged by how many people can see it.
Touch it and build a future on it.
That in my view is the strongest critique of the last economic era.
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall,
more wealth has been created than in all prior years
a human history combined.
But in advance economics,
that wealth accrued to a far narrower share of people
than any healthy society can sustain.
Now AI threatens to replay that same pattern.
Early gains are flowing to the owners of the models,
the data, and infrastructure.
The open question is what happens to everyone else?
Now this is the part I have highlighted, guys.
Listen closely.
If AI does to white collar work,
what globalization did to blue collar work,
we need to confront that directly.
Not with abstractions about the jobs of tomorrow,
but with a credible plan for broad participation in the gains.
The quiet part out loud.
What is Larry think talking about?
First of all, he just openly acknowledged that the last decade,
or few decades, last, you know,
has created the most wealth in human history,
but not in real GDP growth,
not in anything that you can touch or feel,
not in anything actually productive.
We talk about on the show a lot, net productivity,
do something valuable for society, right?
He's talking about wealth creation in nominal terms and dollar terms.
It's another way, it's a politically correct way of saying,
Larry thinks you're a acknowledged,
we've printed more money in the last some odd decades
than ever before in human history.
That's what he just said, which is true.
And he said, we don't really have that much to show for it,
but a really small populace of rich people.
There's like a little tiny sliver of humanity
that's ungodly rich because they are asset owners
and have benefited from the money printer.
And then he goes on to say,
by the way, do you remember what happened to blue collar workers
when globalization kicked off?
Well, white collar workers are going to face the same pain
because of AI, we don't have a plan.
I've never, I mean, the red allios of the world,
the Larry thinks of the world.
The fact that these guys are saying,
what I'm saying on my show means shit's really going down.
I used to be like, whoa, Jack really is out there
with his commentary.
That guy needs to be careful.
Does he have security?
That's how people used to comment on my shows.
Larry think and I, we got the same opinions.
We say the same shit when we're getting interviewed.
Okay, so what is Larry think talking about?
Well, this is the employment in manufacturing
in the United States.
And this is visualizing his comments about globalism
and what happened to blue collar workers.
So for those of you listening and not watching the visuals here,
in 2000, it fell off a cliff.
What happened in 2000?
China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
And as we've talked about, if you want to be the world reserve currency,
you have to run deficits.
You have to export the dollar.
You have to import the stuff you consume.
You do not make the stuff you consume.
Your currency is strong.
Your assets are strong, but your labor force is tremendously weak
because it's not competitive.
So China, therefore, has become the world's factory.
So all of these jobs did not disappear.
They're now in China.
Okay?
So blue collar work doesn't exist in the United States anymore.
And I've talked about this before, guys, but something that we have a huge issue
in the United States is what is called elite overproduction.
This actually comes from a book I highly recommend it.
It's called the End Times by Peter Turchin.
And he predicted that the United States would go through
some form of empire collapse.
And his two core KPIs to recognize this trend was one real wage growth.
So not wage growth, not your salary growth in dollar terms,
but in real terms, how much grossries, vacation, housing, family
is wages getting Americans.
And as real wage growth declines, you get a really disgruntled,
unhappy and eventually revolutionary population.
People start marching, protesting, assassinating, etc.,
as real wages decline.
That's historically been fairly true.
The other is what he calls elite overproduction,
really interesting concept.
And I'm going to try and simplify his idea,
but again, I encourage you to read the book.
His idea is that if everyone feels like they need to be
a high flying tech executive, or a Wall Street trader,
or a super, super duper smart and cool venture capitalist,
that means everybody feels like they need a college degree.
Everyone feels like they need the high flying internship.
Everybody feels like they need to be living in Manhattan
or in Silicon Valley.
He calls this concept elite overproduction.
And when there is elite overproduction,
that means there's too many people that are trying to
strive for elite status with not enough opportunities
to fulfill them.
And so you end up getting a university educated,
well articulated, well coordinated,
young group of people that are swimming in debt
and have no job opportunities.
And these are the people that typically are revolutionaries.
These are the people that coordinate oftentimes
political violence.
It's very interesting how he goes through it in the book.
And I would wage to say we're kind of seeing that today.
Right?
There are very smart, capable people that are very well articulated
and coordinated that are turning into revolutionaries.
Or you can see this in the socialist movement that are basically saying,
fuck property rights.
I went, I got, I'm up to my eyeballs and debt.
I've done everything I was told to do.
And now you're telling me robots have taken my job.
Fuck this.
Whatever Elon Musk has earned, split it with me.
Fuck property rights.
Anyways.
I digress.
The point is, you have a country that has no blue collar jobs.
You have a country that has no middle class.
Okay?
These things wouldn't be a problem if not everyone needed to be a
tech CEO to make it out well in life.
Where can a factory?
Mine critical minerals.
Go find rare earth somewhere so that Trump can shut the fuck up.
You don't need to be a high-flying VC.
You don't need to be an AI engineer.
You don't need to be a Wall Street investment banker.
But no.
The middle of America is utterly and completely destroyed.
You can't make a living without getting a college degree.
The number of asset holders without a college degree is like near zero.
Okay?
So Larry thinks point is, what happens when AI does the same to white collar
as what globalization did to blue collar?
What happens when AI in anthropic takes everyone's software job?
Takes everyone's legal job?
Takes everyone's accounting and finance job?
What happens then?
Because you guys think things are bad now where there's no blue collar work
and there's no manual labor work and everyone has to get a degree
and fight with each other for the most elite positions in the country.
And when you don't get them, you want to go kill someone.
You want to riot.
You want to protest.
You want to take people's property.
Wait until the white collar jobs start going bye-bye.
So here I have consumer credit.
So consumer debt service payments as a percentage of disposable income.
This thing is about to go to the moon.
Because here's the problem guys.
Deflationary technology does not work in a monetary system that relies on inflation.
It doesn't work on a debt-based system.
Everybody has a mortgage, has a credit card, has a car loan.
The world works on debt, has student loans.
The current financial system works on debt.
It works on the expectations of inflation.
If it meets something like deflation, like AI, it runs into a lot of problems.
So what's going to happen when the guy that's a lawyer
makes a lot of money so he has a million dollar mortgage,
$20,000 credit card bill every single month.
He's got a $50,000 car note on his Porsche.
What happens when AI takes his job?
Who's paying that debt?
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
And for the record, I don't want to make this episode too bleak.
But if you're interested, go Google suicide rates in the middle of America,
in the Midwest, in the blue collar country, in the Rust Belt.
Go Google, drug overdose, suicide rates.
I mean, it got bad.
When you're unemployed, you have no life purpose.
It leads to divorce.
That leads to relationship hardships, financial hardships, substance abuse, suicide.
I mean, like, you come to this show, right?
For no ads, no political bias, no corporate bias.
You come to this show and you listen to me for the truth, right?
Sorry, kids, close your ears.
That's it.
It's not looking good.
It's looking bad, okay?
Now, we can fix it.
We have Bitcoin.
We have hope.
But it's looking bad.
And this tweet from Luke.
So, first of all, Jim Bianco says, the Bitcoin carnage is accelerating at the time.
He tweeted, it's now down 12% today.
This is the fourth worst, this decade.
The other three times, it performed as bad.
Something was quote-unquote breaking.
And he sites COVID.
He sites the FTX.
Cabacle.
What else did we have?
Silicon Valley Bank.
I'm sure that was a really bad day.
Okay?
Luke adds the commentary.
And Thropic just told us that white collar unemployment may soon be driven to levels that would make this whole system go boom.
6% to 7% unemployment ought to be more than enough to light the fuse.
So again, liquidity is tightening.
It's delivering.
Tech is getting slaughtered.
Real things are getting reprised.
And look out below.
And the overwhelming point I have on this episode is yes.
In the near term, is it painful to be holding Bitcoin when it goes down 20%?
Yeah, of course.
And this is why, can never add too much leverage.
You've got to stay humble.
You've got to stack sacks.
You've got to be in it for the long term.
I've never met anyone that's a short term winner in this game.
Ever.
Ever.
Okay?
But I think it's healthy.
Get these tourists out of Bitcoin.
Get them out of here.
If you're not owning Bitcoin for the right reasons to monetize it as a hard asset.
And you're a highly levered, high time preference.
Tech software junkie.
Get out.
Get out of our asset class.
So next chapter, liquidity is rotating into the,
quote, real and quote economy.
Okay?
So from Bloomberg, Trump to launch $12 billion critical mineral stockpile
to blunt the reliance on China from the Hill.
Vance pushes for price floors on mineral trading.
The point is, and I, again, a bit rhetorical,
but I think, or a bit repetitive excuse me,
but I think, and rhetorical, I guess.
But I think important.
Capital is being redirected to what they're calling the real economy.
Real assets.
Real stuff.
Rejoining domestic infrastructure, domestic infrastructure,
industrial base and defense base.
Less financial engineering.
So less of these frothy multiples.
All these paper contracts.
Everyone I said, silver is really this silver and gold.
This is like one of the largest margin calls I've ever seen.
Because there were more paper contracts than real assets.
And the problem was, you can't build AI infrastructure with a paper futures contract.
With a paper silver contract.
You, you need the actual silver bar.
And so when the world realized, like, oh shit,
I have all these silver futures, but I need the actual silver.
I need the physically settle.
It was like, oh boy, there isn't enough silver to physically settle all this paper.
So enough of the financial engineering paper games.
Reprice physical reality.
Stock buybacks are dead.
50 to 100 times multiple is dead.
The world is being reprised in real time.
This is a very, very, very different liquidity regime than the 2010s.
Very different.
It's very important.
We understand that.
This is a visual that just shows the era of tech buybacks is dead.
Is a huge deal.
These are the biggest companies in the world.
Their multiples are actively compressing in real time as I talk to you.
That liquidity is trying to find hard assets, real things.
Places to save.
Wealth.
Okay.
Even the best look cheap.
Okay.
Microsoft.
One of the best biggest companies in the world.
It's down 20% over the last six months.
Microsoft is getting hammered.
It's like a shit coin.
This is insane.
And it's not because they're missing earnings.
It's not because they lost profitability.
None of those reasons.
It's for all the reasons we've talked about in the episode.
Okay.
So the next chapter.
Bitcoin's misclassification will not last forever.
So this is short term pain and it's necessary.
All of us Bitcoiners knew in the back of our mind.
At some point, we're going to have to grow out of this relationship that we have with tech.
Bitcoin's always moving with tech.
It's not like gold yet.
It isn't traded like gold yet.
And that goes down to the people that own it.
That's why we as shape these people out.
These tourists need to get out of here.
Okay.
And so Bitcoin traded like software because software owned it.
Why Bitcoin got dragged down?
Even investor base, same liquidity pools, same forced selling dynamics.
When these guys were getting pinched.
When they were delivering, when they were getting margin called Bitcoin got hit.
You can see it in all the correlation charts I showed earlier.
The really important point that I feel like I don't need to say to this audience.
But, you know, it's worth repeating.
Bitcoin doesn't need what companies need.
That's a fascinating thing.
Bitcoin doesn't need high margins.
It doesn't need buybacks.
It doesn't need earnings.
It doesn't need higher capex.
It's not a company.
It's not a tech stock.
It's crazy that I have to say this out loud.
But clearly Bitcoin is still misunderstood by the broad investment public.
That's just a fact.
And we now know this based on its recent performance and correlation to software.
It's just a fact.
So this, I mean, if anyone was questioning how early we were,
we're so early that some of the largest capital pools in the world still don't understand what Bitcoin is.
But this is a blessing in disguise is my point.
You guys know, I'm an eternal optimist.
I think the human condition is being an optimist.
Believe in the future.
Yes, this dip is painful.
To me, it's a huge buy opportunity.
I'm scraping the assets I don't need them.
Buy buy buy buy buy buy.
I'll get into that in a second.
But I do hope that this is the beginning.
Now, I'm not saying tomorrow.
Bitcoin's not going to trade like software.
This is the beginning, hopefully, of us closing this chapter of trading like tech and beginning a new chapter of trading like a hard asset.
Like the only finite asset you can get your hands on.
Like the best money in mankind's history.
It's my hope, okay?
The pain is constructive.
No pain, no gain.
Okay?
And we will see.
So checking in on Bitcoin.
I know that dips in brief bear markets or long bear whatever.
It really kicks people's ass.
It gets hard.
I know that.
I've been in this game for a very long time.
And I know from first-hand experience and just from my peers.
So I wanted to make a chapter, make a section of me walking through.
Just visually showing you guys some of the Bitcoin price charts I look at.
Because I think the pain, here's what I need you guys to understand.
I think we are not in the beginning innings of pain.
I think we're in the latter half of the pain.
I'm not saying that that was the bottom.
I'm not saying we're going to 100k.
These things take time.
That's okay.
Okay?
That's okay.
We're going to look, we can do it.
We're going to be fine.
Okay?
This is all healthy.
It's all good.
We had to wash out these tech throws at some point.
I'm glad it's now then later.
Okay?
But I wanted to walk you guys through just visually why I think according to data,
we're closer to the end of this pain than you think.
So first of all, the classic cartoon, the stay humble cartoon.
Now, stay humble is usually when the price is way high.
What's the opposite of stay humble?
Stay convicted?
But my point is look yourself in the mirror and remind yourself why are you in Bitcoin?
What gave you conviction in the first place?
Because let's tell you guys this.
The price dropping didn't change that there's going to be a block every 10 minutes on average.
Didn't change the monetary policy.
Didn't change the monetary properties.
Nothing has changed.
Okay?
This is why you have to not use too much leverage.
Not exceed your means.
Earn more than you spend.
Okay?
Be responsible.
Be humble.
Always be stacking.
Here's another thing.
If you wanted to sell.
Now obviously hindsight's 2020.
Should have done it.
Don't do it now.
Is my point.
At least, you know, I usually do what you need to do.
But I would advise against it.
Okay.
So now let's look at some charts and reinforce what I think like.
I think this is very healthy.
I think this is a good thing better now than later.
We had to go through this at some point.
Let's go the only way out is through baby.
So the first chart nothing more than a healthy correction.
So if you just zoom out a little bit, the chart looks great.
We made new all-time highs that we had previously set during the COVID era.
We went up to 125,000.
We're coming back down, finding some support and accumulation back around those all-time high levels
between this $60 and $70,000 number.
And I think we're going to be primed to make more all-time highs.
The chart looks really healthy.
Some more just chart porn.
Some data for your eyes.
This is the longest oversold since weekly RSI peak in Bitcoin's history.
Okay.
So Bitcoin has now been oversold for a hundred bars.
So what I'll show you guys from here on out is why I think this is not the beginning
of a bear market.
As I've said before, I think Bitcoin's not been in a bull market for quite some time.
Because I look at it measured in gold, not in dollars.
Dollars distort your reality because they're printed out of thin air.
So it really messes with how you view the world.
How much is an egg really worth?
How much is a house really worth?
It's really hard when everything's measured in dollars.
It's like wearing drunk goggles.
Okay.
So I don't think Bitcoin has been in a bull market recently.
It's been trending down against gold.
If anything, I think we're in the back half innings of a bear market.
I think the pain will subside soon.
How do I know that?
Well, let's look at this one.
BTC percent of the supply in profit.
Only 50 percent of active bitcoins are in profit.
That is insane.
Bitcoin's at 70,000 and only half of Bitcoin's own are in profit.
And by the way, if you look at this chart in 2015, Bitcoin found a bottom when a little
under 40 percent was in profit.
Then a little above 40 percent.
It found a bottom in 2019 and then in 2023, a little under 50 percent.
Now it's a little over 50 percent.
And you have to ask yourself, okay, does that logically make sense?
I actually think it's fascinating.
Yes.
Every time Bitcoin finds a bottom, it should be a little bit higher in percent supply
in profit than the last time.
Why?
Because what is happening?
Tourists are getting shaken out.
People here for high-time preference and for the wrong reasons are getting shaken out.
Eventually, over time, you build a really, really strong base of people that are monetizing
Bitcoin and saving in it with no intention to ever sell.
To capitalize their family, to capitalize their business, to capitalize their life.
Right?
And so every single time Bitcoin finds a bottom,
is slightly less percent supply in profit than last time because the capital base under it has gotten stronger.
Okay?
So the first bottom Bitcoin found in 2015 was a little under 40 percent.
The next bottom in 2019 is 40 percent.
The next bottom in 2023 is a little under 50 percent.
Now we're approaching 50 percent.
So if you're to say, is this the beginning of the bear market?
Are we in for a lot more pain?
Listen, I don't know what the bottom is going to be.
Could we get another wick down into the 50 k's into the 40 k's?
Sure.
I have no idea.
Okay?
I have no idea how much leverage is in the system.
I have no idea who's about to blow up.
Who knows?
But are we at the tail end of the bear market?
Yes.
According to data, yes.
Hang in there.
Hang in there.
Hey, you're okay.
You're going to be okay guys.
I mean, the sentiment online is insane.
We're going to be okay.
Okay?
So the situation has already begun.
This I am a subscriber to checkmate stuff highly recommend it.
This tweet from him, net profit and loss broken down by year of coin acquisition.
The class of 2025 and 2026 have collectively puked out $1.5 billion a day in losses on the move lower.
That's the equivalent to June 2022, which is FTX days.
That's the $17,000 per bit coin.
The situation has begun.
We are in the thick of it.
We are in the eye of the storm, baby.
This is where the money is made.
No pain, no gain.
You better stiffen up that upper lip, mother fucker.
Okay.
You're going to survive.
You're going to be okay.
You want to come to the show and get a little bit of optimism and get a pep talk.
Man up.
Man up.
You're okay.
Okay?
We're not in for another two years of pain.
We're almost to the other side of it.
Brace up.
We're washing out the tech bro's liquidity is rotating.
Bitcoins.
The scare system you can get your hands on.
This thing's going to reprise higher.
Clinch those cheeks.
Here you go.
You're going to be okay.
Okay.
The mayor multiple.
The mayor multiple just takes Bitcoin's price over the 200 day.
Okay.
So it's just trying to find how his Bitcoin's price performing against the trend.
The mayor multiple is approaching deep value.
Okay.
Look at the bottom there as low as these things have gotten when they found bottoms.
We are approaching deep deep deep value.
Meaning can Bitcoin go lower?
Sure.
Can Bitcoin have already bottom?
Yes.
Yes.
This is the time to turn on your DCAs.
This is the time to convert your paycheck into Bitcoin.
This is the time to get some exposure.
This is not the time to lose conviction.
This is not the time.
And let's do what you want.
Right.
I already know the Twitter clippers are going to clip this.
Like Jack's begging people to buy his bags.
Do whatever you want.
Okay.
Friend to friend.
Bitcoin or man to man.
Man to woman to man.
Okay.
I'm just trying to help you out.
We are in the end innings.
You're going to survive.
The worst may be over.
And if there's worse from here, it's not going to last much longer.
We're living through the capitulation.
We're in the deep value.
The Bitcoin percentage and profit is at levels that makes a bottom.
We're almost there.
Sometimes it's really that simple.
Look at the moving average in the Bitcoin price.
We have entered a zone where it is historically really valuable to buy.
It's like it's sometimes it's that simple.
You've only had three other opportunities to acquire at this relative price.
And look at sometimes Bitcoin hangs around here under here for a while.
And sometimes it's sharply recovers.
Okay.
The 2021 is what I want you guys to look at.
That was COVID.
Bitcoin dropped 50% in a day.
Everyone's panicking.
Everyone's selling.
Bitcoin's going to zero.
And then it went from $3,000 per Bitcoin to $70,000 per Bitcoin in like a year.
So turn the DCA on.
Here's the thing.
Here's what you guys needed to decide for all the people that are emotionally damaged.
And by the way, I'm not saying that this is easy.
The next time people say, oh, you just got lucky.
This reminds me of like when all the people from my hometown or all the people that aren't in the industry.
Oh, yeah, you just got lucky.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to hold something from $50 per coin to $125,000 per coin and not fucking touch it?
Do you know how hard it is to have an asset go down 80% plus over and over and over again.
And for the smartest, most credible people in the world for the world's politicians for everyone that you're supposed to trust.
You're supposed to learn from.
You're supposed to care about everyone saying you're an idiot.
You're wrong.
You're stupid.
You're poor.
And not listen to them.
Do you know how hard that is?
So the next time in a year from now when Bitcoin's at 200K and someone says, oh, you just got lucky.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
These are the times you earn it, okay?
These are the times you earn it.
Double down on that conviction.
No fee, no spread, DCA, paycheck conversions on strike.
Start getting yourself some corn.
Hang in there, okay?
And the last chapter I have for you guys is that all the clues are right in front of us.
So is this going to be a multi-year bear market?
Again, according to the data, everything that I check on when we get into bear markets.
I guess I've been in this game for a long time.
I've been in this game for well over a decade, okay?
I check the same KPIs.
I check the same things to get a pulse on the market to see how we're doing, okay?
According to what I look at, we're in the bottom 20%, 10%, maybe 5% of the back half of the bear market.
It's there's not that much pain left.
Now, how fast are we going to go up?
When's the new all-time high?
I don't know, of course.
I can't know that.
Anyone that tells you they know that is a fucking liar.
They're selling you something, okay?
But what I can't tell you is the clues in front of us are a parent.
You just have to open your eyes.
So this chapter is called, all the clues are right in front of us, okay?
Bloomberg, this is very sneaky.
This didn't catch a lot of Bitcoiners eyeballs for some weird reason.
I couldn't believe it.
You know, you've got anthropic and AI in the Super Bowl and bad bunny.
And that half-time show.
All the shit, okay?
Bloomberg came out with an article,
Worsh call for Fed Treasury Accord stores debate in 30 trillion dollar bond market.
Okay?
I'm going to skip to the bottom of this article and read,
Looming over any Fed Treasury talks would be Trump,
who last year argued that one of the central banks duties in setting interest rates
is to mind the government's debt costs.
Those are currently running at an annual clip of a trillion dollars a year,
or half the budget deficit.
Quote, rather than insulating the Fed,
it could look more like a framework for yield curve control.
Tim Doi, chief U.S. economist of S.G.H. MacroAdvisors,
set up an Accord, a public agreement that synchronizes the Fed's balance sheet
with the Treasury financing explicitly ties monetary operations to deficits.
Guys, the clues are right in front of you.
You just have to be paying attention.
Bloomberg and Worsh and the chief U.S. economist of macro advisors
is telling you their planning yield curve control,
which by the way, let me put that in layman's terms.
That means the Fed is going to print dollars out of thin air
to buy U.S. treasuries, which is another way of saying
the Fed is going to print dollars out of thin air
to lend to the U.S. government, which is another way of saying
that the United States is going to print money out of thin air,
highly inflationary, highly good for things like golden bitcoin.
Like the clues are right in front of us.
Remember, Worsh is a politician.
Do not believe for a second, he's anything other than that.
Trump jokes about suing Worsh if he doesn't lower rates.
So what have we read since this guy got nominated?
Trump is going to sue him to oblivion if he doesn't listen
and that he is a beset disciple, a Stanley Drunken Miller
disciple, and they're planning some type of relationship
with treasuries to cap rates on treasuries
and implement some form of yield curve control.
The clues are right in front of you.
Okay, right in front of us.
Hang in there, hang in there.
Get these tech software levered Wall Street junkies out of our asset class
by their dip.
If bitcoin is capitalized and held by hollers of last resort
of people that are monetizing it that are saving in it,
it will start trading like a hard asset.
It's never made sense that it traded like a tech stock.
It's because a lot of these tech guys got into it over the
2010s and these large swaths of liquidity.
And now that there's a liquidity regime change,
a lot of that's unwinding.
Hang in there.
Turn on your DCAs.
We are almost home.
We are almost home.
Okay, company updates.
These slides were misplaced,
but I also wanted to put this in the Closer right in front of our face.
The gig is up.
China is dumping treasuries and loading up on gold.
And then look at this press release, by the way.
China urges its banks to curb US treasuries exposure on market risk.
Chinese regulators have advised financial institutions to reign in their
holdings of US treasuries, citing concerns over concentration risk,
and market volatility.
Like, it's getting real.
China's literally telling their banks like,
yo, be careful with these treasuries things.
Like things are changing fast.
Like do not own that dog shit.
Meanwhile, the guy who's about to lead the central bank of the Fed
is saying, yeah, these treasuries are so bad.
It might make sense that we implement a public policy
where we print out a print money out of thin air to cap the yields
so that things don't go haywire.
Oh, man.
All right, company updates for those at care.
I'll try and breeze through strike.
I'll try and breeze them both, honestly, because there's a lot in here.
Okay, strike first and foremost.
We've updated our margin call policy.
So we can talk about lending and, you know,
people on the internet have plenty of opinions about me, which is
weird place to be in, but whatever.
We've updated the recovery window, 72 hours.
So previously, if you got a margin call,
you needed to update your position within 24 hours.
We've updated it to 72.
And our recovery threshold was previously 60% LTV.
It's not 65% LTV.
And I just want to say something.
That Thursday was like utter and complete chaos.
Okay.
Markets are moved.
Like, there's no circuit breakers.
Markets don't close.
There's no help from any central parties in Bitcoin.
Free market every man for himself.
People can say what they want about me, about my companies.
This is proof of work.
This is showing the fuck up.
Okay.
In the heat of the storm, I of the tiger.
We were listening to customer feedback observing the market
and said, how can we take on more risk as a business
that we think is reasonable and an effort to help people out?
That's the effort to make our product better.
And we did.
I mean, the strike team is just championship attitude
right there.
Never too high.
Never too low.
We just get shit done.
And so I want you guys to know this as customers
of the product because it benefits you tremendously.
And I want to shout out my team.
You know, working for me sometimes, you take a lot of stress.
It sucks.
I don't know why that is.
You know, the more I've become a public figure,
it's really weird to live through.
Like, people feel like they know you.
People feel like they have a right to a pine on your life
and a right to know what's best for you.
And they feel like they have a right to criticize you
and judge you.
And for some reason that sometimes extends to my business
and my employees.
And not only is all of that bullshit and ridiculous
and obviously it's just the internet.
You can't take it too seriously.
But I mean, shit like this.
Like the strike team needs credit where credits do.
I mean, this is, in my opinion, this is heroic shit.
This is, this is a company built by Bitcoiners for Bitcoiners.
That's what that looks like.
Not what people say, a lot of other Bitcoin startups
they're marketing campaign is trying to convince the world
that I'm a bad guy that I'm compromised, that I'm the devil.
That's like how they attract people to use their product.
Use us because that guy sucks.
Okay.
That's just a lot of talk.
It's a lot of proof of stake.
It's a lot of fiat.
This is proof of work.
And so I want you guys to know for those that use our product.
But then I also want my employees to hear me say out loud
what I think they deserve to hear, which is
that is the culture of this business.
Very proud of my people.
That is very cool.
Very cool.
Very cool.
More updates from strike.
Bitcoin back loans are now available in Texas.
We finally got Texas.
One of the biggest markets for us.
Sorry.
It took so long.
They were iffy with the license.
They were like dangling our lending license in front of our face.
We finally got it.
So very excited about this.
If you're in Texas and you're interested in a Bitcoin back loan.
I think we're the best in the business.
Pricing.
Just a recap of the product.
You can have a monthly payment loan.
You can also have payment at maturity.
So you don't, you know, we just take the interest.
We roll it into the principal.
You owe us in a year.
We've got our line of credit coming out in less than two weeks.
It'll begin to roll out.
So very proud of this.
Looking forward to working with people in Texas.
Especially the miners out there.
I think our line of credit product for miners could be really interesting.
Alabama.
We also got Alabama.
So our Bitcoin back loans are available there.
We lowered our minimums for Indiana.
So Indiana, our minimums are now $10,000 for a loan.
Just incredibly exciting.
What else do I have for you guys?
Our, like I said, our line of credit product will begin rolling out in a little less than two weeks.
We can have, which is very, very exciting.
So that product is just a reminder.
We give you a line of credit against your Bitcoin that acts as a payment method.
So when you go to buy Bitcoin, when you go to pay a bill, whatever you want to do on strike,
you can use the bank account, you have a tax, you can use your cash balance.
You can also use a credit line against your Bitcoin.
And so that is for people that want to use this Bitcoin back loan type of product.
But they don't want to take out a massive loan over a 12 month duration.
Because I will say, one of the things I think is awkward about the product today is that to take out a loan against my Bitcoin,
I have to borrow against my, I have to borrow a large sum that's going to last me 12 months.
And then what happens is people say shit, it's only option is a 12 month term.
Well, I have to borrow more than I actually need right now.
And then I get worried about getting margin called and what if the price goes down.
And so we crafted a product like sometimes you do need a large loan.
You're buying a house, you're financing your wedding, you're paying off large debt.
You have a medical emergency.
But sometimes you're just looking to pay your credit card bill, you're just looking to pay your rent.
You're just looking to pay a really small expense.
And you don't want to take out a massive 12 month loan.
You just want to pay the bill.
And so the way, you know, I use it, for example, and I would encourage others to use it.
Because you have some Bitcoin on strike.
And when a bill comes in, your credit card, your HOA, your rent, whatever it is, your electricity bill.
You hook up your strike account where the line of credit handles the bill.
So the bill comes in, strike extends a mini line of credit, pays the bill for you.
And says, hey, we extended your line of credit.
$2,000 in paid your rent.
And then you're not, you're not like, you know, taking out this massive loan against Bitcoin.
And if Bitcoin hits a certain price level, you've got to add more collateral.
Then it's like, you know, these tiny little loans.
And then as your paycheck comes into strike, you can say, hey, I'll take half my paycheck, pay down my line of credit.
The other half of my paycheck, I'll stack some sacks.
And then you're kind of slowly managing this is more for people that are living their life on top of Bitcoin.
And not using these products for, like, massive one-off expenses.
So very, very, very excited about that.
And then we will continue to, I mean, look at how many updates I had just in the last week.
I mean, we expect New York very soon.
So we'll continue to roll things out as we can.
But the really, really big one I'm excited about is the line of credit.
And then for 21, we continue to work on the operating business.
So as I said, our goal is to be able to produce cash flow with high margins and growth in the Bitcoin industry and pair that with a large treasury.
We think that that would be the most appetizing Bitcoin company in the public markets.
And we're putting together, you know, the announcements and what we will be ready to share and regards to the operating business.
I get it.
Public markets have been tough on me.
I can only say so much with strike.
I can tell you guys whatever the fuck I want with 21, that's not true.
And so that is my update today.
And now we got Q&A.
So a little over an hour for that episode.
We'll keep Q&A, whatever 10, 15 minutes maybe.
Hopefully.
But that was a fun one.
Well, you guys learned a lot about Bitcoin.
It's correlation attack.
Hopefully it's ending.
And you got a little conviction that the pain isn't forever.
You're going to be okay.
Hang in there.
This is my fourth fifth quote unquote bear market.
You're going to survive.
You're okay.
By the dip.
By the dip.
All right.
Let me blow up my screen.
There he is.
Full scrub.
Who does blue eyes?
Man.
I so blue.
Wow.
Blueer than the sky.
Um.
All right.
Some pull up.
Don't ask questions.
Okay.
Q&A.
Macro questions to start.
Could you please explain how institutions like Black Rock sells their BTC ETF?
And there's no impact on the price.
Are we dealing with paper Bitcoin?
Price manipulation?
It appears to me.
I don't think so.
Um.
So I do think that these derivative products amplify Bitcoin moves.
But both to the downside and the upside.
I think that these paper products create.
Um, leverage into the day.
You got options.
You got futures.
It allows people to get exposure without the physical.
And so I do think that it's an amplifier to price movements.
And so.
I do think that.
These products amplify the price movement downwards for sure.
But I also think that when Bitcoin rips to the upside, it will amplify the price movement upwards as well.
So I think that they are price amplifiers.
They allow more liquidity to be a part of price discovery.
But I do not think that the Bitcoin price is being manipulated.
I think I made a very clear case that I think the Bitcoin price.
Is falling unfortunately in this like software tech unwind.
Which is kind of funny because it's.
It's it's a hard money assets.
But obviously, I mean, you know, 16 years ago, it was zero.
And we were mining the first block.
And now it's one of the largest asset classes in the world.
And it's going to have to continue to flush out people that misunderstand it.
Have the wrong time preference.
Don't have the right conviction.
It's done this time and time and time again.
It's flushed out big blockers.
It's flushed out shit coiners.
It's now flushing out tech software investors.
And inevitably and eventually it will be capitalized and monetized by people that are treating it and saving it as money.
And I think it's just living through one of those chapters.
The more financial instruments we have, the more amplification to price movements.
But that's okay.
That's what we want.
We want it to be highly liquid, highly sellable.
That's a monetary property that we seek out.
So, and to be quick here, but I can expand on if you guys want.
I've always fundamentally believed big coins far harder to manipulate than something like gold.
Because the only way to use gold is to deposit it with a government, with a bank, with an institution.
Because you can't send gold over the internet.
I can't send it across borders.
I can't pay for my Uber eats with gold.
I can't do shit with it unless I physically walk it or fly it or seal it where I need to go.
And so, gold was always highly, highly, highly concentrated, not only in ownership, but physical custodianship.
Bitcoin, that's not the case.
Bitcoin is distributed fairly via proof of work to the people.
And so, it's very difficult to manipulate Bitcoin.
Because we see on Twitter all the time, all time low of supply on exchanges, all time low of supply on exchanges.
And all of these derivative products are tied to the physical spot price of the asset.
And so, if there's an all-time low on some random exchange, some random overseas shitty exchange.
But Bitcoin over there goes to 150,000.
Well, guess what?
The CME futures is going to have a really tough time staying at 70,000.
And people are going to, you know, with their other coins and then the gig is up.
So, it's going to be a lot more difficult to control Bitcoin than people think.
I think people are just frustrated, and they want Bitcoin to go up, and they want someone to blame.
And I think this is healthy, natural, wash them out, the convicted stay, the strong remain.
We're better asset for it, we move on.
Question, if AI drives deep deflation and job losses, does liquidity dry up and hit Bitcoin first, or does massive debt force more printing that ultimately boost Bitcoin, short versus long term?
Probably both, right?
So, yes, if there's a deep deflationary wave, a lot of things are going to get absolutely crushed.
If unemployment goes to 6 to 7%, there's a lot of delinquencies on consumer debt, consumer debt as a percentage of income goes through the roof.
Then, yeah, like a lot is going to get crushed.
And the bond market also, so the yield on the bonds, so we talk about yield curve control, the 10 years going to go through the roof too, yield.
Because, you know, a lot of the United States receipts their revenue comes from taxes.
And so, if all of a sudden, everyone's unemployed because robots and AI models took their job,
well, then AI models aren't paying capital gains and income tax.
And so, then the market will also be like, fuck, the US is even more broke than it was, because it doesn't even have revenue to offset the massive amount of deficits that are growing.
Trump wants to spend more on defense, more on the critical minerals, more on raerers.
And so, yes, if that happens, it'll be a little massive gut punch to markets, but that's when they print the money.
So, again, you know, you have to ask yourself some fundamental things.
One, do you think that the system is going to fail via austerity and outright collapse, or it's going to fail via inflation and default through debasement?
You have to answer that for yourself, right?
Do you think that the United States is going to let everything collapse on itself when we go through a great, great, great, great, great, great depression?
Or do you think they're going to continue to print the money?
Because then everything's short-term.
You know, long-term would be austerity.
Everything would be pain.
And then on the other side of that, Bitcoin will still win.
Because at the end of the day, it's competing to be money, period.
Doesn't matter how long it takes and what it has to go through.
It's, is it the better money than the other thing you're holding or not, yes or no?
And eventually, I believe it'll win that battle.
The question is the path that has to walk to get there.
And if history is any teacher, we know they're going to print the money and that we've been slowly defaulting via debasement.
We've slowly been defaulting via inflation.
And we know that wars is going to come in and cut rates and likely implement yield curve control and help these deflationary forces.
I mean, if you listen to Basin, if you listen to wars, if you listen to any of these guys, they're saying we have to grow our way out.
AI is a huge thing's like, AI, they're big on Bitcoin.
You know, we have to use hard appreciating assets, things that everyone owns.
We have to use AI to grow our way out, GDP growth, but that's highly inflationary.
That inflation is going to realize itself in the yields of the 10-year, right?
As inflation goes up, people lending to the US government are going to want to get paid more.
If the price of eggs and vacation and housing is going to go up, well, you got to compensate me for that if you want me to lend you money.
And so in order to cap the prices, cap the yields, they're going to yield curve control.
So I think all of the above to answer your question.
And that's why you've got to be in it for the long term.
You've got to lower your time preference.
You've got to hang in there.
Okay, you've got to hang in there. That's why I message, don't exceed your means.
Okay, live within your means. Earn more than you spend.
Lower your time preference. Stay convicted. Simpleify.
Hang in there. Okay.
For every winner, there's a loser.
Very, I mean, the truth is, and this is very unfortunate, all of us are not going to make it out alive.
All of us are not going to make it to the other side.
The coins of fixed supply asset, not everybody is going to get access to it at the same price.
Your body that isn't listening to you is going to see the signs, see the light, and he's going to start stacking it $500,000 a coin.
You just got to hang in there, hang tough.
Thoughts on Japan re-arming.
They will likely prevent Taiwan take back, which will happen by 2030 likely.
Our World War III run back question mark.
And I mean, just reading the research that I've read out a China, they don't want to fight in for good reason.
They're killing it.
Pause.
Twitter clippers. Please don't clip that and quote me on a context.
China's killing it. Here's how China's killing it. Listen, I don't think the CCP is a good thing.
Think we should abolish the CCP.
What do I mean? China right now. This is a fun fact that I learned reading research this weekend.
China right now is graduating more engineers per year than the US has in total.
Now, you can say, well, that's because their population is so much bigger.
So what? Why does that matter? Sounds like we need to have more babies and focus on, you know, studying the right topics.
They're outproducing us in engineering. They're smarter than us on a lot of critical topics.
They're way wealthier than us in critical minerals.
And they're running now a trillion dollar trade surplus annually and growing.
So what I'm reading out of China, they don't want to fight.
I don't envision a hot war. I don't think that's on the cards.
I think China is like, we're not going to own treasuries.
We're going to push the world into this new monetary regime.
We're going to stack gold.
But think about it. Like the whole rare earth thing.
China was very clear. They're saying, we're going to stop giving you guys rare earths because you use those rare earths to create weapons to bomb us.
And we're done with the fighting. We're done with the violence.
We're not going to give you access to the materials to create the weapons to hurt everyone else.
We're going to strip you from the ability to create more weapons and hurt more people.
We're done with the fighting.
Let's do this with economic warfare, okay? You guys resure.
Surely that's going to cause a lot of inflation.
Surely AI is going to be really disruptive to your inflationary economy.
You're going to need yield curve control. You're going to go through a lot of political stability.
You're going to go through your own fourth turning over there.
We have our own problems. We have our own agenda.
But we're going to, you know, we're going to focus on our own hemispheres.
Whatever.
Trying to didn't react to the Venezuelan. You guys got Venezuela.
Fair game. They didn't. They didn't react.
So this is not what I want. This is not my ideal.
From the research I've read, no one's really interested in a hot war.
So I don't expect a World War III.
And I pray we don't have one.
The fight is over artificial intelligence.
The fight is over critical minerals.
The fight is over supply chains.
This fight is over engineering.
Right? The fight is over.
Like that is what is going to be defining.
Trade surplus is defense industrial bases,
manufacturing, whoever wins the AI race.
Supposedly that's a national security threat on both sides.
I don't think it and I hope it doesn't involve real missiles.
Hey, Jack. How much is worse for going QE in unexpected headwind?
What meaningfully affect the liquidity that would be used to buy Bitcoin?
I don't know. I don't think so.
If you look at markets, nobody's pricing in.
Like a tremendous amount of rate cuts.
I don't think anybody is expecting that of a warsion.
In fact, everything's down tremendously since warship was nominated.
The markets did not like that.
Like according to the markets,
Trump nominated the only hawk that was available.
Like, oh, you should have picked the black rock guy.
Assets would have gone to the moon.
But as I said before, these guys are politicians.
Don't forget that.
It's like, so we just watched everything drum power in Trump put us through.
All the clownery, all the fuckery.
And then a new guy's going to step in.
And you guys aren't going to size them up as what we've been watching this whole time.
You're like, oh, no, this guy's different.
Who the fuck are you kidding?
Come on, guys. Wake up.
This guy's a politician.
He's going to print the money.
He hasn't even gotten started yet.
And Bloomberg's issuing headlines like,
Just so everyone knows and calms down.
He's really into yield curve control.
That's insane.
By the way, for those that don't know,
yield curve control is like full degenerate money printing.
That's the apex of money printing.
Because you're not even hiding it.
That's above QE.
That is literally creating dollars out of thin air and handing it to the government.
That's not well, you know, mortgage back securities,
rolling off the balance sheet.
And if you do the math up here and you divide it by over here,
that is just flat out like,
here's a keyboard.
Create as many dollars as you need.
And we will buy the bonds that you issue
so that the yields stay kept.
Yield curve control controlling the yield curve.
So I think that the market is going to be surprised
that this guy is a politician and a disciple of Basin
and a disciple of Drunken Miller because the math is the math.
All bit coiners align on math
and on mathematics.
We want to be governed by the universe,
by Mother Nature, by cryptography, by math.
Well, the math of the United States
is they have to print the money.
It doesn't matter how nice of a guy or how mean of a guy
or how cool of a guy or how stressed of a guy
doesn't matter.
I don't give a fuck about this guy.
This guy has to print the money.
And that's what he will do.
And every single day that the markets get scared about it
and start selling off more,
we're going to get more Bloomberg headlines
and more New York Times articles,
reinforcing that he's going to print the money.
And that's why Trump elected him.
And it didn't matter who Trump elected.
Trump got elected me unless I wanted to die
and get in prison for the rest of my life,
you have to print the money.
That's the math.
Okay, moving on to Bitcoin and markets questions.
Greetings from the Netherlands.
Wow, past midnight.
Thanks for tuning in, man.
How do you look at the scalability from Bitcoin?
If everyone on earth would use it,
we consume more energy than the world right now,
just for BTC.
Just for Bitcoin.
Um, I got a few thoughts here.
For one, energy consumption is not a bad thing.
Okay, let it be known that the story of humanity
is commercializing energy from the sun.
Commercializing energy from that orange thing in the sky
is the story of our species.
Being able to turn energy to heat our homes,
fly us across the ocean, drive our cars, power these lights.
Energy consumption is directly correlated to human prosperity.
The more we've been able to commercialize and benefit from energy,
the better off as a species we've been.
Period.
So the notion that energy consumption is a bad thing is a lie.
I've said frequently.
Oh, you don't like energy consumption?
Well, I'll tell you what.
The next time we go to Europe,
I'll fly on a Boeing and you row a kayak.
The next time you need to wash your clothes,
I'll use my washer and dryer.
You use your hands.
The next time you want to watch a sporting event,
you turn on a hand radio and I'll turn on my flat screen.
The next time you need to commute to work,
you walk, I'll drive.
I am a energy consumer.
I always will be.
And I want to produce and consume more.
I'm not going to feel bad about that.
Now, the second thing.
So for one, all the like energy and a sayers,
like, oh my god, Bitcoin uses too much energy.
Good.
That means it's valuable.
That means it's part of the human story.
Doesn't airplane use too much energy.
The lights in your house, to your car,
everything around you consumes energy.
Now, then the next question is,
well, how much energy should Bitcoin consume?
As much as it demands.
If there are people that have access to energy,
and they point it at the Bitcoin network,
that means Bitcoin earned that energy,
according to free markets.
Because they could have plugged in a TV.
They could have powered an airplane.
They could have done a lot of things with that energy.
And instead, they used it to mine Bitcoin.
So, whose fault is that?
Bitcoin's?
That means Bitcoin is a good use of energy.
That means the human species likes Bitcoin.
Don't read the news.
It's trying to understand if people like Bitcoin.
Look at how much energy is used on Bitcoin.
That will tell you how much people like Bitcoin.
Turns out people love it.
It's a good use of energy.
Let me tell you something.
If someone is from a country with a collapsing currency
that's living under an authoritarian regime,
half the world lives under an authoritarian regime,
an oppressive government,
restricting them of their fundamental human rights,
things like freedom of speech, things like property rights,
abusing them physically.
And then they're hyperinflating their currency.
So, all of their time, their energy, their effort,
their labor, their work,
is being stripped from them via currency debasement.
Let's picture someone like that,
in Venezuela, in Turkey.
Who are you to say that Bitcoin is not worth the energy?
Let me say something.
Do you think that that person in Venezuela
would say you're right?
Turn Bitcoin off.
I'm glad you have a washer and a dryer.
Glad you have a television and can watch the world cup.
No, no, no, no, please.
Fly first class to Europe when you take your wife on vacation,
but the energy is not worth Bitcoin.
For me, have you lost your fucking mind?
That's what I would say to these people.
It's not up to you.
What's worth energy or not?
It's a free market.
And guess what?
Bitcoin's worth the energy.
And guess what?
Human flourishing is correlated
to our ability to consume more energy.
I would work on how we can consume more energy
instead of telling other people how they should consume theirs.
It drives me fucking nuts
when people tell, no, no, no.
You're living wrong.
You're saving wrong.
You're consuming energy wrong.
Hey, guess what?
Fuck you.
Sock my dick.
These are the worst version of human beings
that we have.
To people that feel morally above
ethically above in self-righteous enough
to dictate what's right for other people.
Next question.
Should someone seeking a loan
backed by Bitcoin take it out at a high point
in the market or at a low point,
assuming average US income?
I'm going to answer this question
in a way here.
Here's my answer to this question.
I'm going to answer this question
by telling you I'm not answering this question
because here's the thing.
And I want to be super clear about this.
And I'm going to stay consistent.
It's not my job and it's not my company's job.
To manage anyone's personal finances.
I've said consistently and repeatedly
do not use too much leverage on anything
on your house, on your salary, on Bitcoin.
Don't do not exceed your means.
Do not spend more than you earn.
These are fundamental things
that I personally believe deeply in.
When it comes to our products at strike
and specifically we're talking about
our Bitcoin backed loans.
Our job, in my opinion,
in my opinion is what matters
because I'm the CEO and I run it.
In my opinion,
our job is to offer the market
reliable trustworthy products.
And so when I'm evaluating risk,
I'm evaluating our risk as a business.
What is the LTV that we are comfortable
offering the market at a substantive size?
What are the recovery windows we are comfortable with?
What is the recovery margin that we are comfortable with?
As long as we are comfortable,
we are reliable.
We are trustworthy.
We can scale with you.
Then it is up to the market.
Can you imagine if I said,
no, no, no.
You guys are using my product wrong.
Going back to my last rant,
it's not my job to determine what's right for you.
I don't know your job.
I don't know how well employed you are.
I don't know your income.
I don't know your savings.
I don't know your marriage.
I don't know your expenses.
I don't know the expensive taste that your kids have.
I don't know the things
and I don't want to know offense.
I love you guys.
I don't want to know.
So it's really important.
Now, what is my advice?
My advice is borrow against a fraction of your coin
so that you have the ability to add collateral.
You should factor in that Bitcoin can go down
40, 50, 60, 70, even 80%.
That should not be a surprise.
That should be within the lexicon of your calculations.
Now, what'd you say assuming an average income
or my brother in Christ?
You're an adult.
You got this.
I can tell you guys how I used the product.
I can give you case studies of other customers
but I'm going to remain consistent here.
It is super important.
We offer an opt-in product.
People say it's your fault.
You're an asshole.
You're an asshole for offering loans.
I'm an asshole.
I didn't force anyone to do anything.
These products have changed people's lives,
including my own.
I don't have to sell Bitcoin anymore.
It's a huge thing for me.
That's a big, fucking deal.
I get to own more Bitcoin than I otherwise would
and I get to sell less Bitcoin than I otherwise would.
That's fucking amazing.
It's very, very important though
that everyone owns self-responsibility.
And you figure out that calculation for yourself.
Question for Jack.
Explain how Bitcoin is a liquidity thermometer.
A emotional human is determined the price
which aren't always rational.
Worst Trump says this, that, et cetera.
Bitcoin's a liquidity thermometer.
In the sense that it's the most reactive
to fiat liquidity.
Bitcoin is priced on future expectations of fiat
whereas an asset like gold front runs liquidity.
So seeing gold at $5,000 an ounce and hearing
the US government talk about,
oh, we might have yield curve control
and all sorts of crazy shit.
Gold is front running what's coming.
You can look at gold and you can see the future.
And the same thing happened in COVID.
And the very early earnings of COVID
was beating everyone's ass.
And then Bitcoin came in the back half and out
performed it by orders of magnitude.
And so a liquidity thermometer meaning that
it's the only fixed supply asset.
It's the only free market.
And so then when liquidity gets weak,
it feels the pain immediately.
When liquidity is abundant,
it enters price discovery immediately.
And these other assets because of market structure,
passive flows because they're not physical, neutral,
commodity-like instruments that you can hold yourself,
that don't have an issue where that aren't associated
with earnings or PE's or a company.
Like it's very unique in that sense.
It's very unique.
Everything else houses, equity, software.
You've got counterparty risk.
You've got earnings.
You've got cap X.
You've got a management team.
And then things like gold are not nearly as tradable
on a free market and as liquidity sensitive.
So Bitcoin is the closest thing we have
to like a real-time index on fiat liquidity.
Hey, Jack Curious.
If you could look into something,
my dad and I want to know if a dynamic DCA is possible
within strike.
For example, if the price dips below a certain level,
we double our triple or et cetera,
our DCA amount.
It's not on the roadmap at the moment.
The most difficult thing in building a Bitcoin company
is figuring out what to build now.
Competing against line of credit, yield on cash.
But we'll send it to the product team.
If enough people want that, you know,
the world's our oyster.
We can build anything.
Did something happen to loans in Portugal?
The future disappeared.
We're live in Portugal.
If you don't see it in your cash tab, the product
just hit us up.
I'm happy to help.
But we're live.
Nothing happened there.
Should be able to borrow against your Bitcoin in Portugal.
Let's see.
Why does strike use plaid?
Why can't we just connect a bank account
and do ACH deposits?
You know what the longer the short answer.
The short answer is fraud.
The US is the only financial system
and I run a global company.
The US is the only financial system
where you can deposit money
and then say, never mind.
I didn't do that and take the money back.
After you already said you wanted to deposit it.
And so plaid and other services offer things like fraud
protection and help companies like ours
fight this ridiculous system.
So crazy.
Like you could buy Bitcoin from me.
I give you the Bitcoin and then you say, oh, never mind.
That wasn't me.
But you keep my Bitcoin.
What the fuck?
So that's why.
For some customers, we do enable no plaid.
Like if you're a super trusted customer,
you really hate plaid.
I know we have the ability to enable it.
But it's just fraud.
Like the US financial system is a mess.
That's a truth.
We're working on, I mean, we know that there's feedback
and there's different things we experiment with.
And we are going to constantly iterate and try it.
I mean, fraud's a top online thing for us always.
Like we have a data team that's consistently iterating
on fraud models and trying to make the experience better
for our good customers.
But anyways, that's the answer.
Check me in from Germany.
Can someone ask later if we can get our DCA and purchase history
or strike app?
I need to go to bed.
It should be, it should be in your activity.
I think.
I can't tell what you're asking.
But I hope you're getting a good night's sleep.
And it should be in your activity inside the app already.
Do you have any plans to bring more strike features to the UK?
Like loading against your Bitcoin.
Regulation is the issue.
But we are, sorry, the end of their question is,
is regulation stopping you?
Yes, regulation is stopping me.
But we are working on it.
And we are going to get the more features there.
For us, it's a matter of when, not if.
If we aren't in the country now or where you don't have a feature now,
it's because of regulation.
I'd never, I'm like, oh, these brits in the UK.
They don't deserve my lending product.
I would never do that.
I would never do that.
So it's always, it's always regulation is the issue.
So if we aren't live with something,
there's a 99% chance because I'm not allowed.
And I'm working on being allowed.
Let's see, any news on getting strike loans going in the EU
would be great in Germany in particular.
Guys, we have loans in Europe.
I'm reading through these questions.
It seems like you guys don't know.
Our lending product is live in Europe.
You want to borrow against your Bitcoin.
You go into your cash tab.
So for you guys, it would be your Euro tab.
And you can borrow against your Bitcoin.
If you have any questions, you can DM me on Twitter,
DM strike on Twitter, reach out to our support staff.
But we are live in Europe with our loans.
How much do I worry about being a public figure in regards to $5
or tax?
I don't worry much.
Not worth the time on this.
That's not even a strike question.
Dillon, our loans available in New York for businesses.
No, we're not alive in New York yet for anything.
But we've been told it's any day now.
Fingers crossed.
Fingers crossed.
Send a prayer.
Hey, Dillon, QS, Jack.
We'll strike ever at the ability to deposit a paper check via mobile deposit.
I know cash app does this.
Yes.
In 2026, we will enable that.
Bill, bingo.
Let's go.
Let's see.
Some of these are repetitive.
Jack, what's the quickest way to get our strike instant limit increased?
I need a large increase.
So much.
You guys can always reach out to private at strike.me.
That's our private client desk.
And whether it's a high network transaction.
You need instant limits for a large event in your life.
You need help with a loan.
You can get on the phone.
Get on a call like this.
Like a Google meet or a zoom or whatever you want with our private client team.
And we're more than willing to help you out.
It's like a white glove service.
So anyways, check that out for this specific instance.
Reach out to private at strike.me.
And that goes for anybody that wants to talk to a human.
It has a request.
It's a one-off instance.
A large purchase.
A large loan.
Something with their account.
Okay.
Other questions.
Jack, thanks for the hope in the education you share.
What biz during art Renaissance will see success in your opinion?
Tell us about your biz background.
Have you started one that didn't succeed?
Yeah, man.
So I think this question is referencing my opinion on how AI and Bitcoin will enable a new art Renaissance
because Bitcoin will allow you to actually save and persist wealth.
So right now, everyone's a speculator.
Once you get your paycheck, you have to use it to speculate, sports gambling,
and hunting on equities, crypto, to gen stuff.
Just to keep up with the purchasing power to eventually buy a home.
And with Bitcoin, you can just save.
You don't have to worry about that.
And so if you're wealth that you're creating today actually last through tomorrow,
and AI does a lot of the mundane white collar work,
then humans are left to be creatives and artists.
And I mean artists not in just painting or music,
but I think my job is an art.
How can I create a show or a product or a tweet or a podcast
that conveys information, education, a message?
How can I help revolutionize a cohort of people on the internet
to rally behind open source software that can change the world?
I view a lot of what I do is art.
And so I've always thought that Bitcoin and AI empower the artist.
Like AI hasn't disrupted me.
It's made me a better artist.
It's helped me hone in on my ideas, do research.
Like the presentations I do now are so much better because of my AI tools.
And so what business will do better during this art Renaissance?
Well, again, I think the world will reprise things.
I think physical things are not priced properly.
Things like Bitcoin, things like gold, things like land,
I don't think these things are priced properly.
I don't think profits are priced properly.
You're seeing these tech companies, all of a sudden go from insane multiples
to barely any multiples at all because the premium is gone.
I think finding a high margin business, a high growth in cash producing business
is going to become more and more of a rarity when there's not just like free money
sloshing around and there are like physical constraints to your business.
I think that is severely undervalued in underpriced.
So I'm super bullish businesses like strike and super excited about what we're doing
achieving profitability so young in our corporate career.
And then I'm really bullish artists.
And again, maybe I should work on defining what I mean by that.
But I think artists are influencers, creators, unique ideas.
Those that can motivate and lead people.
Those that inspire.
These are all things that AI can't do.
I can't get AI to manage and motivate a group of employees.
I can't get AI to create visionary concepts and revolutionize people on the internet
behind them.
And so I think companies will have less head count and less overhead when it comes to people.
But there will be a higher premium placed on the best performers and the best artists.
And like there's an art and even executing.
Like it's an art to take an idea and take a vision and actually do the work.
Prioritize things in the right way.
Manage people effectively.
Set the right goals.
Get shit done.
That's an art.
It's not a hard skill.
Like, oh, I'll just take that one class of Cornell and then I'll figure it out.
Grinch an art.
So I'm bullish.
Whatever that is.
Human creativity and artistry within your craft.
You know, certain people will be worth way more to a business.
Everything else will be automated.
So I don't know if that.
I don't know if there's specific.
Obviously AI can't replace restaurants.
So, you know, hospitality will still be an industry.
I think there will still be a premium on a fine dining experience.
But anyways, I don't know if that's good answer or not.
Let's see.
I think that's it.
Is that all, though?
I mean, I've been so active on Twitter trying to refute thought.
I'm surprised you didn't put any of that in here.
But maybe that was a purposeful decision.
I'm just checking.
My text messages and the chat.
Cool.
Okay.
I will, I think that's it guys for this week.
Keep giving me feedback.
I read all the YouTube comments and the tweets and stuff.
I try.
It's a, I'm growing and like pride that I am one of the most accessible, you know, CEOs.
Whatever you think I am, podcasts.
You can tweet at me.
You'll get a response.
You can leave a YouTube comment.
No, I'll read it.
I want this show to be good.
I want it to be educational.
I want you guys to learn from it.
I want you to be entertained.
So, all the improvements.
I think someone said this is a two year anniversary because it's episode 104 and there's 52 weeks in a year.
So, I guess I've been doing this for two years.
And the beginning episodes were not very good.
And these are much better.
And that is in large parts of you guys.
You guys really direct me telling me what to do less of, what to do more of.
So, keep giving me feedback.
Hang in there.
You know, hopefully the Bitcoin price charts and some of that data was useful.
The worst part is almost over.
You're going to be okay.
No pain, no gain.
If it was easy, everyone would do it.
You're okay.
You're going to survive.
Hunkered down.
Green pastures ahead.
And the dip weirdly is because of software.
But I think it's a good thing in the long run.
And with that, I'll catch you guys next week.
Same time, same place.
Peace and love.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Bye.
