Welcome to the University of Podcast.
And so, Argin, you are 22, 19.
You're 19, okay.
So 19 means, you were born in 2006.
So you're born five years after 9.11.
The financial crisis, you were only like two years old, right?
So, you know, with video games,
people spawn into the battlefield,
in the middle of, you know, like a moba,
you know, everybody shooting into each other.
And there's like this giant thing
and some spawns into the middle.
And so, I think of you kind of people,
the Gen Z types,
as spawning into the middle of this totally chaotic situation.
And I just want to tell you,
it wasn't like that in the 90s and the 2000s.
I don't know what your perception is at,
or maybe you perceive this chaos as normal.
I mean, I was born with a lot of things
that I take for granted, right?
Which means, when is the U.S. where you are?
In India?
In India.
So, you know, I've like, for as long as I remember,
I know like having a computer, smart phone,
and kindness after a while.
So, which is to be all?
Give your life story, your Z cash guy now,
but which is give your skill.
Sure. So, you know, I was a pretty normal kid,
I would say, when I was up to like 13.
You're still like, yeah, but go ahead.
Yes, fine, fine.
Got it.
And so long, COVID, when I was like, you know,
doing whatever teenagers would do, play Fortnite, you know?
And then COVID hit and then I just like,
What were you then?
In India.
Okay.
I'm American accent.
You have a global accent.
In a national media, just talking to a lot of people.
Okay.
So, I, anyway, COVID hit and then I just started reading
a lot of books, like the beginning of infinity,
the ball of the book, the development act.
And then I just started questioning a lot of things
that take a granted.
And just started questioning the meaning of it all, right?
Like one month in school, like I don't want to be
just growing up studying engineering, like everybody else
and you know, you know how the Indian reality is.
This is the growing studying engineering, but I'm sure, yeah, yeah.
But you know, yes, that kind of life.
It's like if it's only a canolized path,
you want to have some options.
Of course.
Yeah.
So, anyway, I got completely radicalized, I guess,
I'd say, and then you want to see, you got book?
No, I exit.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You, well, you got enlightened.
Can I make sure?
Sure.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
And then I, you know, when I was time to go back to school
because when I was online school, I was just like me
at the side and then, you know, right from a blog,
right on Twitter, but then when I had to go back to school,
I was like, this sucks.
I'm out of here, right?
So, Dr. Doha's school worked on air chat for a while
up in the wall.
And we sunset that, you know, I guess a couple of years
ago now and then sort of got involved with Z-Cash.
Great.
Okay, so Z-Cash, right?
So, the Z-Cash never see.
Okay, so my view is there's many
problems that Z-Cash solves.
Some of them are, obviously privacy, simplicity.
Quantum, you know, like a quantum resistance,
quantum resiliency, let's say.
Up to some, some point.
Up to some certain point, right?
And, and it has at least a roadmap for resiliency, right?
And like Sean Boe has a good post in this.
And then scalability of attacking on, right?
And then, it's also got some degree of lindiness
or what have you given that's been around for 10 years,
got a good security track record.
It's got a good change of integration, community,
all the kind of stuff.
And Z-Cash is interesting because
Sloan, a guy's like it, metallic likes it.
I like it, novel likes it.
And, you know, it's something where,
I think we can build a coalition around privacy.
And you've certainly experienced this yourself.
It's funny to say, like, how does the you think
about privacy and so it's different, right?
I love to hear your thoughts and I'll give it thought.
I would say, I'm like, I don't hang up with a lot of you,
my age, right?
So I don't know the, like,
would like regular people my age think.
But for me, I think privacy is super important.
Like, I don't, dox my location anymore.
You know, I used to when I was a kid.
Right.
Didn't really realize the downside of it.
Yeah.
But now, you know, especially with AI being able
to recognize where you are exactly.
And you need that on chain, I think,
because you can't have freedom without privacy.
And if it's like every transaction you make
is broadcasting your entire wealth to the public,
or, you know, where you are, what you're doing,
I don't think that's the world that I want to live in.
Yeah.
And I think a lot of people don't fully understand that point.
If you're under surveillance, you're not sovereign.
Yeah.
And one way of putting it is,
if every move is being tracked, for example,
you don't have the advantage of surprise.
You can never launch something.
You can never have private deliberations.
You don't have the room to make mistakes.
Anything you do, can it will be a sketch
you and so and so forth, right?
And, you know, there's,
I know where it putting it is.
What does privacy mean?
Say, arguably it means local files and local data.
So that's also the same as what sovereignty means.
I mean, privacy is private keys.
Is private property is not online.
Like almost decentralized and local and individual
as opposed to communal and shared and public and whatnot, right?
So that's a sense in which sovereignty is privacy
is locality and is security.
It's creativity, right?
Like, I'm not going to be creative.
I'm not going to be myself.
My authentic self, if I'm always being watched.
And like, I would think like knowledge creation
of all creations is comes to a stall
if all, everything is so away all the other time.
Yeah, it's funny.
You know, like one thing I used to say,
some of the people would tell me, oh, biology,
you know, China is going to just be the same as Japan.
And it's going to like run into a ditch like Japan did.
But the way I point to something is actually in the early,
in 2017, actually, Salzburgers paper
and my tea published something that said,
that China killed a bunch of American spies in 2010.
Japan could never do that.
So that's why China, that's another way of looking at it.
So, you know, I'll obviously very different national security
sense, but China's sovereign in a way that Japan isn't,
because it could kill the spies, because it stopped the spies.
Obviously, I'm sure America's killed Chinese spies as well,
but Japan would never be able to kill American spies.
And you know, so Japan is under surveillance
and was it sovereign, but China wasn't under surveillance
and was sovereign, right?
So the ability to actually be free of surveillance
is actually in a sense to be sovereign.
And the alternative doing it is to encrypt.
Not through violence like the Chinese way,
but through decentralization and encryption,
which is the internet.
Yeah, he basically tweeted,
Z-Cash must scale.
Why scaling Z-Cash a moral imperative?
Well, it's because, look, I love Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's amazing.
I don't never have a negative word to say
that Bitcoin over what Soshi did and so on.
But he developed it in 2009, right?
2009 was many generations ago, technologically,
you'd make different trade-offs potentially today.
Especially quantum has improved a lot.
We know a lot more about blockchain scalability.
Obviously, we know about smart contracts.
You know, obviously AI is out there, blah, blah, blah.
So Z-Cash must scale.
It just means right now, how does Bitcoin scale?
Off-chain and other chains.
Let's say, off-chain,
which say you load Bitcoin into Coinbase or Binance,
and then within the internal Binance
or Coinbase economy, you have a debit and a credit,
and you can just send a receipt of zero fees.
And only when it's recorded out as a transfer out,
is there an on-chain transaction, right?
So off-chain is basically database entries.
And then other chains means you swap Bitcoin into something else,
and then you send it on that chain.
Slon or Ethereum or something like that.
Or USDC on Ethereum or Slon.
And that's fine, you know, that does work.
But many of my friends who are still,
like Bitcoin Maximalists or would have you,
I'm sympathetic to them,
but they basically been saying, oh, Lightning is gonna be there
any day now for 10 years.
Literally, 10 years of Lightning.
And the thing about it is when you press them,
they're like, oh, well, Lightning,
there's no public database of it,
because it's supposed to be payment channels between two nodes.
And when you go and you look into the details of it,
basically the thing about Bitcoin is,
any address can send any other address at any time,
any amount without any setup at basically,
let's say standard fees, minimal fees, right?
That anybody can pay anybody any time,
anywhere, any amount without any setup,
is a set of things that is all broken with Lightning.
Any node cannot pay any other node with Lightning,
unless there's a channel or a route between them.
They can't pay any amount because it's constrained
in a complex way by how much of the deposits are there.
They can't do it necessarily at any time,
because you have to have like a channel open and channel close.
Ah, and then the amount of money is like,
it's like bound in a complicated way
by like the deposits on the channels.
And then what do you get out of all this
where you get is something where like,
you know, maybe if one part of your other party breaks
a payment channel, then you can get like the last transaction
out or something like that.
But the transactions are being recorded off-chain,
which is why it's quote scalable,
to make Lightning work and to apps like Moon
and so and so forth that try to make like MUU
and in a wall of the Satoshi.
So they're fine, like these guys.
But basically they end up essentially
setting up a hub and spoke topology where it looks a lot like
here's Coinbase, here's Binance,
and they've got a ring of customers around them,
and they have a channel between them
where they can do quick Coinbase to Binance settlement.
So that if you send within Coinbase from another Coinbase customer
or within Coinbase to a Binance customer,
maybe Coinbase to Binance is it could be off-chain
or it could be like a very quick Coinbase Binance like daily
or nightly or whatever hourly settlement,
how are they decide to do it?
But if they have an agreement,
they have a pure relationship, they can move fast.
This is very similar to how banks work, right?
Banks essentially mean within a bank,
it's fast, it's just a debit credit in their system
and between banks they use Fedwire or something
and they do settlement and they have a true up
where it's like the net credit, the net debit
and they just true it up like this, right?
And so the hub and spoke implementation of Lightning
is really not in my view, doesn't get you much
or just loading in the Bitcoin
and doing off-chain transactions
and having a pure relationship between moon
and wallet of Satoshi and Nostur and whatever, right?
Damis.
And that's all fine, and there's a bunch of people
who will basically give me some kind of argument like,
no, it works forever and then whenever I poke on it,
it's always some hub and spoke thing under the hood
and it's not like truly decentralized in the sense of,
it's not like Bitcoin where you can see it on chain,
anybody can pay anybody any time, any amount,
without any setup, blah, blah, right?
Okay, so what you really want is on chain scaling, right?
Just blast the transactions on chain.
What's funny is if Ethereum actually
learned the same lesson as sense as Bitcoin, why?
Like, you know, and to be clear, again,
I'm pro-bicone, pro- Ethereum, like,
Vitalik posted that L2s kind of didn't work
and to be clear, a lot of the L2s are smart people.
I think they will adapt and pivot.
I've actually had a close coming out on this from L2 to App2.
You can turn those L2s into AppChains
and you have Ethereum for global state.
You have your computer for local state.
And then if you have like a decentralized notion,
like an obsidian, use the L2s for App state
that you're syncing across computers.
Like, you know, like your username of archen.e
through Balagia study is global, but the state
that you're moving if you're doing a file share request
or something that doesn't need to be global state,
it could be L2 state, and then you have local App state.
Fine.
So leaving that though, the thing is,
L2s were fine as a hack.
They were more successful on Ethereum
than they were in Bitcoin.
Like, base and polygon were actually quite important.
Are important.
But really, this is a lot of model.
Just blasting it, you know, events on chain work, right?
Because it's easier, conceptually easier.
You don't have to think about, I mean,
blockions are complicated enough without having to worry
about like, oh, where's my coin?
What chain is it on?
It's easy to make mistakes on that.
It's easier for users to make mistakes.
You're forcing them to be aware of a detail
that they really shouldn't be aware of or have to be aware of.
And so Solon is model of just blasted on chain
and have beefier hardware work.
And that was maybe not obvious few years ago,
but that model worked.
And it became also very clear
that the value of cruel is going to Solon,
and then an app on Solon is doing something Solon
isn't doing.
And so that worked, right?
So now we have basically three love says Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Solon, in terms of scalability on chain, right?
And so now the question is, can we go further still?
The ZK, obviously there's ZK roll-ups,
there's optimistic roll-ups, you know?
The ZK is not simply a privacy technology,
it's also a compression technology,
it's a performance technology.
And in fact, arguably, even though the ZKash came up
with the content of the ZK, the utility of the ZK,
saw use more in scalability than it did privacy at first.
This is good because scalability was immediately
commercially important, you know,
that's saying vitamin versus the painkiller.
No, no.
Like, you know, a painkiller is,
it's maybe a meal, y'all.
Sure, yeah, okay, yeah.
You've got a meal problem and you want to take care of it, right?
And the vitamin is like possible upside, right?
And you can argue, but basically,
I know we're putting it as,
all like a painkiller's a must,
and a vitamin is a nice to have, right?
Like a, like a, like a, like a, you know,
a blonde has supposed to be in need, right?
So making more money requires scalability.
So I was a must, right?
And it seemed for a long time,
like people could do without privacy.
Or rather, it wasn't like,
it wasn't as important as scalable, so people thought.
But now we have all of these attacks on people
for like, you know, doxing locations, so and so forth,
where if you're, now, if you're in Dubai,
or you're in a low crime jurisdiction,
Singapore, if you're in El Salvador, perhaps,
and so and so forth, you're fine, right?
Those are going to be three very important places
on the Earth, in my view, Singapore to buy El Salvador,
are the new, like Tokyo London, New York.
Like, even Miami is maybe, I think El Salvador
has more upside than Miami,
because it's a start of sea.
Like, I actually like France as far as a lot.
Miami and El Salvador will probably have an important relationship,
but El Salvador is like a full sovereign, right?
It can do a lot.
And to deal with Elan recently, it has tether there.
These are big moves, right?
So, Bekelli is like Bekelli Kwonu.
And those get you the Americas,
EMEA and APAC, right?
It gives you all three times,
so El Salvador or Dubai, Singapore.
And those, if you're doing, if you're saying a bathing in crypto,
I think you, or anything in tech crypto,
those are going to be the three nodes.
One thing we need to do,
I should post this afterwards,
like President Bekelli should set up direct flights
between Dubai, El Salvador and Singapore, El Salvador,
and build an international airport.
And you don't have them already?
I don't think we have them.
Partly, it's because South America, Latin America,
has been sort of locked off from the rest of the world,
especially Asia.
And lots of flights have to route through America.
And to route through America,
if you're not a US citizen,
you have to get a so-called, like,
I think a CVs transit visa, so many people
who want to go to Cresciamento and Argentina and their Asian,
they don't have a US visa or something.
You have to, like, go to the US embassy to get a CVs
for just, like, it's a huge tax.
You want to just fly from, let's say, India to Argentina.
You have to stop through the US,
but to even stop through the US,
you need, like, a C, Trans-Apisa,
which means you need to go to the US embassy
and apply for a visa once in advance
to jump on a flight.
So, it takes away all spur of the moment.
It's like this enormous tax of time
and energy.
You can get rejected for that visa, it's often not awarded.
So, having someone like El Salvador,
which can just route around that,
will be very important, like an enormous amount
of traffic will go there
because debying Singapore, these huge, huge points.
Anyway, coming back, so on chain,
just being able to blast private transactions,
on chain, salana-like scalability, but z-cash
is what, I think Sean Bowen may have with Tachyon.
That seems simple, scalable, easy to understand.
It's what a lot of people want a big point to be, you know?
So, yeah, so that's all I think about that, right?
What also will take to be the official currency of the network state?
There's no official currency to the network state,
I think, because there's going to be a thousand neighborhoods, right?
It's like, there's going to be like a thousand cities,
start up societies, thousands start up cities,
thousands of neighborhoods states.
But, I think there will be, just like there'll be a salon
and a neighborhood state, a theorem network state,
don't die network state, Coinbase network state,
Binance network state, all these people have talked about,
telegram network state, etc.
There will be a,
a z-cash network state.
The only thing about z-cash historically
has been that the z-cash people were so into privacy,
they never talked about it.
And also, z-cash itself for a variety of reasons,
just, you know, most crypto things have a failure mode
of being way too commercial
and like too much, get money now, too much,
you know, like when air drop, mean coin,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Once in a while, you have a project,
which has an opposite failure mode.
Or, if not failure mode,
except if things you guys just failed at all.
But rather, the reason that they haven't,
like, they've been sort of shadowed by other projects is,
they were so academic, right?
They were so academic, like you can overreact
and be too non-commercial also, right?
There's good and a lot of ways in the old cryptography,
they're very smart, they're playing a long game,
all the kind of stuff.
But you need the right equilibrium, right?
You don't want to be too PHD.com,
you don't need too PHD or too.com.
You want to have the right synthesis.
You're going to change that?
Yeah, I think we're changing that.
Right, you guys have Gen Z-cash.
Yes, that's right. Tell me about that.
Yeah, so I just thought it was a cool little...
It's fun, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, it's good, yeah.
Yeah, it's a plan where it's so, um,
it's, yeah, I think the idea is like,
you know, a lot of things start from young people
and then the old generations just like catch up, right?
We're the five best Gen Z-cash videos
or we're the best ones, which ones are bad.
Well, do you remember?
We do want to do.
That's true.
You know, we had the Z-cash network state event.
Right, yes, yeah.
We did want one to seed.
Did a couple of one to see the first one
when Z-cash was a $30 second one when it was a $700.
Nice, that's good, that's good, right?
We've been by, so.
Yeah, well, I mean, I love a seed, obviously.
But of course, keep going, I'm listening.
Yeah, uh, there's a few more interesting ones, um,
but yeah, I think we want to ramp up, um,
starting more.
Okay, so what is, where are the themes of Z-c-c-gen Z-cash, the feed?
Fun, for sure.
I don't know what to make a fun.
Make privacy fun, make it sexy, make it cool, um,
and I think educating, um, like, you know,
you don't want to be like, you just want the user to know
as much as they need to know.
Like, um, that's why I love Zashi, right?
Because Zashi, there's all these different shielded pools
with Z-cash that, you know, if you really wanted to dig deep,
you could like learn all about them, and the other apps
kind of force you to learn them, uh, but Zashi is all just default
into the shielded orchard pool, right?
Um, so as little information you need,
but to use it properly, obviously, like, you know,
you're not leaking information anywhere.
Um, so I think, you know, educating about that, not be great.
Um, but yeah, one more question about, uh,
I had about, uh, you know, you're talking about lightning and Bitcoin.
Do you see a world where, you know, Z-cash is sort of a complement to Bitcoin?
Where it's actually a question.
Yes, the thing is, I mean, one thing to not underestimate is,
like Bitcoin has, like an insane brand, right?
It has been, I mean, when we're putting it is,
there's a lot of people who are just now thinking about Bitcoin or whatever,
and what they'll say is something like,
Argin, what kind of Bitcoin should I buy?
Right? I'm probably heard something like that, right?
So that is, I know where I'm putting it is, for example,
how many drone manufacturers can you need?
I know, mocking the streets into the small one.
Yeah, more of the big ones.
Most people can teach you.
Yeah, I maybe take any mandrel, right?
So you have to be really into it to be able to name like small ones.
That's just probably a friend of yours.
Yeah, that's not exactly.
So, but to be able to go down the list of all the various drone manufacturers,
it's like DJI is like Bitcoin, maybe Andrewals, like Ethereum,
it's a military drone very different, but it's a drone manufacturer.
And then, like to know more than that,
you really have to be in the space, right?
So if you think about it that way, right?
Like, again, like most people, the name and AI, the name CheshipiT, right?
And to be in the space, to know Gemini and Claude,
and if we really in the space to know, like, I don't know,
seed ants that just came out to soap and model
or the Chinese mumbling and whatever, you know,
clan, balla, deep sea.
And so, you have to, that's a useful way of modeling.
And our example is like, how many Chinese politicians do you know?
You can paint?
Exactly, right?
Can you name Lee Chang and all the other people
in the Plurting Prop, most people can't, right?
So, that's a good way of thinking about how people from the outside
think about crypto.
They just don't Bitcoin.
They just don't like the one name in crypto is Bitcoin, right?
That's sort of like the, there's a power law on brand, right?
So, don't underestimate that.
That's like a huge, huge, huge, huge thing.
So, because of that, number one, and Bitcoin's just insane, ubiquity,
and, you know, like all the kind of stuff,
and Bitcoin will be around and do well for a long time.
Also, there's an aspect to being public on chain,
like transparency and privacy are actually both useful things, right?
And for Bickelli to be able to prove that he has this amount of Bitcoin
is actually useful for him at times, right?
If he can secure the private key is, there's a sense of which Bitcoin literally
does become digital gold, right?
It's something where if you use to actually show your proven reserves, you know?
And then you need proof of reserves and liabilities in general,
because, you know, you know, it's not just that you have 100,000 Bitcoin
or 10,000 Bitcoin, but rather all the claims on them out up to this, right?
That's like another level of it.
But at least proof of reserves shows you that you have something.
And so there's sense in which it's possible,
because transparency and privacy are both useful features.
It's kind of like immutability and programmability of both useful features.
So Bickelli is immutable, and Ethereum is a lot of a programmable,
mutability, like in the sense of if you Google mutable state,
that's like a core concept in programming.
That's like the thing that Bickelli doesn't want to do
that Ethereum is a lot of must-do, but it's like these are both valuable things.
Immutability and programmability, but you can't have them the same package.
It's like, you know, I want a drink water, I want a warm fire,
I don't want fire plus water, because they annihilate each other, right?
So you need to have them separate as things, right?
So it's possible that Bickelli, just like Bickelli and Ethereum,
co-exist because Bickelli is immutable and Ethereum is programmable,
Bickelli and Zikaesh co-exist because Bickelli is transparent,
and Zikaesh is private.
And you may want to have proof of reserves, right?
That's because Zikaesh is T-addressants.
It is actually addresses, that's true.
This way, you can do that.
But there's something also where the total sum of Zikaesh
can't be proven as easily as the total sum of Bickelli, right?
Maybe there'll be some cryptographic technique that does that,
which is probably possible, but it's not quite as simple as with Bickelli,
where you just download blockchain, run a verifier, sum,
all the chain tips, and you get the sum of Bickelli in the raw, right?
That was a troll that people used to run an Ethereum.
They say, how many eth are there, right?
And they can show a script that just simple, just show it how many BTC they were.
You can't say how many eth there are, right?
You can say how many transparency there are.
And certainly that's an upper bound, like, you can also say how many Shields
that there are.
You can see how many Shields that are on the table.
That's true, that's true.
But it's a little bit less, anyway, people can use arguments in social media.
It's like a little bit less trackable than Bickelli's.
And sometimes it's a feature.
So anyway, that's those are the benefits of an older technology,
our ubiquity, brand, and perhaps transparency.
And we shouldn't underestimate that.
I mean, one thing that's interesting is,
you know, in Facebook was in its early days.
Twitter was, and Twitter was in its early days.
People said, oh, Twitter is just Facebook's Seattle subjects, right?
Because Facebook, there was a time when said, like,
Argent is, yeah, and then you could type in a box.
And if you remember that, it actually is before your time.
You was like five years before your born or something like three years.
But 2004, 2007, you had that.
Like, biology is, and you type something in.
And then eventually, the biology is, when a way,
you've just typed something in those tests,
it'd be similar to a tweet.
But it'd be like, biology is, it was an update of AOL in St. Messenger.
AOL in St. Messenger, you'd say, John is a sleep.
And that was like, you're a way message.
Or John is at the office.
So it would tell people where you are,
almost like an answering machine message.
So answering the machine message became an ICU or an AOL in St. Messenger
away message, became a Facebook sales update, became a Twitter tweet.
And so that's the evolution of it, right?
So the answering machine became a tweet.
That's not the only lineage, but part of it.
Pointless, people thought, Facebook can do all these things.
So it can do only one thing.
Therefore Facebook will just crush Twitter.
It turned out that the simplicity of Twitter
meant to just build a community around it, right?
That's the other thing that Bitcoin has just as gigantic community,
hundreds of millions of people, right, are part of Bitcoin.
And like, you could say, for example, that,
kind of what's a good version of this.
Like, I don't know, maybe El Salvador is a better Mexico.
But how many people are going to move from Mexico to El Salvador?
Community has a stickiness, all sorts.
You know, that's not exactly right.
The Internet I'm saying, right?
So yeah, I don't know what the future holds,
but I'm a pro Bitcoin, pro Ethereum,
Pro Selon, and Prozy Cash.
Because it's, we're still in this very non zero sum mode for a long time.
All this, all the intricate coin fights.
I think there's a healthy competition and so on.
But, but I think this could be a easy cash.
Let's see.
Awesome. Cool.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Sir, great, he's there.
