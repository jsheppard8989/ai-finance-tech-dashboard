I think when we work on really hard problems,
we have to approach them with joy and humor and a spirit of
it's okay if it doesn't work because the journey to doing anything hard
like to remember there was a map that we did. Remember the one like it's like,
you start and it's like, oh, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be easy with the pit of despair
and there's like a giant pit of despair and if you can't have fun,
you're gonna like, like, just like flail in the pit of despair, right? And the way you kind of
cross the pit of despair is when you're with others who you can you can play with.
I'm so glad you brought this up, Emily, because I knew exactly what you meant.
But it's easy to hear when when you or someone else says, we got to play.
Yeah. And what gets taken away is, oh, it's just a playground.
They're not serious about what they do. Whereas in fact, I think what you and I and
everyone else here feels is, we're so serious about this hard work. We know that
seriousness is not the way to do it. And so we're serious about the outcome,
but we're playful about the process, not because we're not interested in winning,
but because we know that for a journey like this, being playful is actually the way to maximize
the chances of something really valuable happening. Yes, 100%.
Emily, I'm so glad we're doing this. Thank you for being here.
Anytime. Awesome. We can start in so many different places, but I'd like to start with,
it's like literally written over your heart. Right here. It says, stop food waste.
Yeah. When did you start caring about food waste? Because, you know, you have a really
interesting, very eclectic background. I know you're into design. You've done teaching at Stanford.
Somehow, food waste has not taken over your entire existence, but it's become pretty central
to sort of how you think about the world. And like, it's become a mission for you. Yeah.
Like, how did you get there? Yeah. Great start to the question.
So almost 10 years ago, Google food had something called a culinary internship program.
So as Googlers, as exters, we could show up at five in the morning and work for four hours in
our kitchens and just like learn how to do really cool things. I learned how to make five
gallons worth of salad dressing at a time. You use like an industrial mixer and you need to have
both hands on the industrial mixer because it's like a very large version of a hand mixer.
I learned how to cook enough, you know, pork for 200 people, you know, for lunch, you know, downstairs.
Right. And it was actually when I was spending enough time in the kitchens in those early
wee hours of the day in 2016 that I was watching what people were doing and how we were making the
most of, I mean, 200 people's worth of pork is like a lot of pork, right? And so it was also
amazing how much of it would go un-eaten or how much of it would just end up in the compost then.
And yeah, that for me, for many reasons, right? It's like money going in the trash can, right?
And it's also terrible for the environment. So I really started exploring this space because
of what I was seeing in our kitchens. And we are already incredibly intentional about it. Our
chefs downstairs are amazing. And we were just with chef Monet downstairs, talking about lunch.
And even then, it's still hard, right? It's one of those really dumb problems in the world that
if we could solve for or would have like such great positive impact on the economy on society and
environment. But yet, it's like really hard to solve. So let's, we'll get to solving it in a minute.
But let's dig in a little bit to how much does this really matter? It's like, how big is this problem?
100%. So at X, we look for huge problems to solve, right? Problems that impact it.
At least 100 million people have not a billion, you know, just like things that really could
transform our lives. And I would categorize solving food waste as one of those huge problems.
And so just to kind of ground us in some of the facts here, in the United States, the average household.
Basically, it could save $1,500 a year. And for a household in the United States, that's meaningful
amounts of money if they could just reduce their food waste by 10, 20%. The amount of food they're
throwing away is literally hard cash. I was also shared by going back to the climate side of the
story, by a good friend of mine who works on food waste, Pete Pearson at the World Wildlife Fund.
I asked him, I don't understand what food waste has to do with pandas, right? And he's like,
you realize that as we cut down rainforests and the Amazon, we could significantly reduce the amount
of agricultural land we need if we wasted less food. So that's why I'm working on food waste.
And that's why the World Wildlife Foundation supports food waste work. And I was like, oh, that's
interesting. So upfront, right, we would need a lot less agricultural land. And then downstream,
the most significant source of methane coming out of our landfills is actually from food waste
and the EPA in the United States, the environmental production agency in the United States,
determined this. And a lot of people have asked me good questions, including my colleagues here
at X, well, why not just cap the landfill? Turns out food waste because of the form it shows up in
in the volume, you have to be able to capture it within the first 12 hours of it showing up the landfill.
So it's not like the anaerobic digestion that happens, layers and layers and layers like
below layers of landfill, it's really at the top of it. And so, and we all know that methane is
80 times worse than carbon dioxide. So, you know, there's so many ways to sort of frame up the
scale of the problem. And it's a pernicious problem because of its scale, but it's also hard because
it requires us to make a decision at every meal we eat, at every meal that we cook,
right, rather than when I know I've purchased a hybrid vehicle, I've done something good. If I,
you know, purchased an electric vehicle, I've benefited from the gains from that every time I drive,
right, this is one of those things that requires not only like our thinking around innovation and
technology, but also how to change mindsets because it's a behavior. It's a behavior, it's also
it's a systems problem. So you can't fix any one part of the problem. You kind of have to fix a whole
bunch of things at the same time in order to really change the sort of food waste equation. That's right.
Um, we're going to get back to food waste, but I want to take a step back. Tell us how you found
us, how you entered X, what was like that first sort of couple of months like, what did you think
about X? And then after you say that, we can get into sort of how you found your way from that
to actually starting a project around food waste. Oh gosh, such fun. I believe it was burning man.
2012. I was part of a, uh, a camp called the leopard martini lounge and uh, one of my really good
friends, uh, from IDO, which is a design firm that invented the apple mouse in a bunch of other
really cool things. Um, my friend Tim Prakar was an electrical engineer at IDO, and then he joined X
early on the Google Glass program, and Tim was wearing Google Glass in the middle of the desert.
But he let me try one of the really early prototypes of Google Glass in the desert. I'd burning
man in 2012, and I was enthralled. It was a fascinating experience. And, uh, separately, I had met
Babak Parviz at Stanford at a design thinking course, who was running glass at the time, and it was
really interesting intersection of relationships and friendships of Cambridge spirits, and also
glass was at that point looking to deploy the first 50,000 units. You can remember the glass
explorer program, and uh, for whatever reason Babak thought it would be interesting for me to join,
and run that because it really is a user research study, but at the grandest scale possible,
right? Like we didn't know what we didn't know, but how users would use this new smart
eyewear technology. So we had to go out in the world with an open heart, and explore,
and he was right about that. It was sort of this really grand user research study that we were doing
with our early users. Yeah, very explicitly. Yeah, and it was this brilliant way of making
contact with the real world. We created something, and we needed the support of 50,000 diverse
individuals across many different professions, socioeconomic backgrounds, to really understand what
the possibilities were. And I, I loved it. Those two years were fascinating because I was able to
spend time with everyone from, you know, people working on high voltage wires, right? Who knew, right?
You know, it would be great for them to not have to hold three tablets when they're like 50 feet
up in the air. To that's how I actually got involved with Google food was because there were
chefs who wanted to be able to capture what was happening in their kitchens for their customers,
who were curious. And if you're juggling four pans of, you know, sauces and
pastas, and other that you're not going to be holding up a phone, trying to like record that,
right? You're going to be cooking. You're going to be your element. And class really helped people
be in their element. And I still believe it. I think it's still true. So, speaking of that,
one of the things later when you started the food waste project at X, one of the
prototypes that you built, you in the team built, was a little bit like Google Glass for a garbage
man. So, instead of having to have people wear the Google Glass, the garbage can had its own.
So, when people scraped it in, we could watch everything that was getting scraped into the garbage
can. Yes, and that's such a great observation because at the end of the day,
it really is what is out of sight out of mind, right? And so, you know, you and I don't spend
our time thinking about our trash because we don't see it. And that's how the industry and
our world has been set up, right? And as a result, we don't pay attention sometimes to how much
waste we generate in general, not just food waste, right? Because it's in the trash, let me
taste away. We don't really pay attention, right? So, actually, equipping a garbage can with a Google
Glass is really wonderful because suddenly we have some degree of awareness. And over the first
year and a half or so of working with the food waste prototypes across our cafes, we were able
to capture 20 million instances of people opening up their trash cans or putting something in the
trash can or compost bin. And we learned tremendously from that. And it was really neat to pattern
match in certain cases, right? You know, certain things that we thought weren't true because we could
now correlate with what we were truly seeing was happening. Do I also remember that you went to
the garbage after this whole building and collected the garbage? And you and your whole team
actually took the garbage outside and strewn it like strewn it, across the whole parking lot
and like categorized the garbage and then re-through it out afterwards? 100% good memory.
Slightly gross for those of you who are not in food waste. I don't expect all of you to want to
like go dumpster diving. It's incredible to be able to thank you for Astro for letting us take
over the parking lot for like a week. Of course, I don't know. It was a great moment. It's true and
you know, all our trash all over the place. Yeah, it was, so it was part of something called
a waste audit. So there's a, we have an incredible partner by the name of Cascadia that actually
does this for Google's offices. And this building that we're in right now at X headquarters generates
maybe 100 trash bags worth of trash, right? And a day, right? It's shocking. And you know,
it turns out much of that is related to food and eating, right? And to be able to sort through it
manually, you know, I remember it's funny for the X 10 year anniversary video. There's a video
of me literally reaching my hand into one of the bags and pulling out a perfectly good apple
of being just stunned by it, right? I was like, why did those not have enough of the trash, right?
And out of that, and I, I strongly suggest that everybody on our team on the Delta team,
which was the name of the team that we ran for food ways, take even five minutes to go through
that experience because it's incredibly visceral. And it's hard to forget when one has a visceral
experience. And so anyways, from that trash audit, it turns out a lot of it was associated with
compostable cups and plastic water bottles. And so we actually have reduced along with X and a lot of
other parts of Google, significant amounts of trash that go out the door every day by replacing
some of those compostable cups and the spills will water bottles. And also, again,
our food waste, right, if you look at it, we separate out from vegetable, from meat because meat
has a much higher, you know, carbon emissions footprint. And then we also separate it from edible
non-edible, obviously, right? So anyways, those experiences are incredibly important. And X allows
and even supports us having these experiences. And I don't think we would have made the headway
we did if we hadn't actually just, you know, spread out a lot of trash all over the parking lot.
Like it was in, which is really important, which is kind of our jams, like get in contact with the
real world, which includes sometimes literally dumpstered. Yeah, exactly. So let's, let's broaden
out from just X and X's garbage. I learned so much just through you and watching the team. But for
the audience, talk us through the ecosystem of trying not to waste food and how complex it is.
Absolutely. It is the world's oldest industry. So capitalism actually started with agriculture,
which enabled so much more and humans society to really flourish, right? It's a $20,
$30 trillion industry in the world. Everybody needs to eat all how many people, 8 billion people,
all of us need to eat agriculture, obviously, also generates feed for animals, fiber for our clothing
and also fuel, right? So it is an extensive industry. Waste happens at every point in that
industry. So let's just take food out of the four, start with food, avoid other three,
out straight out. You start with the farms, right? On the farm, every farmer will grow a little extra
because no one can control the weather. So if I'm on contract as a strawberry farmer to produce for,
let's say, safe way, grocery store, five trailer trucks full of job areas, I will probably try
to grow six trailers worth of food. Because you'll be in trouble if you don't have at least five.
So I'm okay if I have five out of six, but I might end up growing six. So what do I do with
that excess, right? Oftentimes I might tilt it back into the ground. So to speak, right? So that's
a little sad because all this food, remember we had to put water, labor, fertilizer, whatever else
to grow that extra six truck worth of strawberries, right? So there's already sort of surplus or waste
in that sense in the farm. And then with the processors, right? I might take those strawberries and
turn them into strawberries, movies, right? And the machine at the processor, for example,
might literally go and just chop off the top third of the strawberries to get rid of the green
parts, right? And so it's like, oh wait, there's actually meat on that top third, right? So I've
wasted some of the edible flesh. Whereas it was just a little bit more dexterous with how it
cut off the green part, they get more strawberry strawberries. Exactly. So there's waste there.
And then for the distributors, right? And the retailers along the way, there's, there's lost
there too, right? Because from a logistics perspective, imagine a truck of strawberries that
has to go from Watsonville, which is 80 miles from here, strawberry capital in the world in my
mind, all the way to New York. It has to survive a five-day trip. And even with
coolers, like we call them refers to refrigerator trailers, there may be a literally bad apple,
or bad strawberry in the bunch, right? And that causes a lot of these strawberries to go bad
before they even reach the retailer. So that whole entire truckload is going to be gone, right? If
some percentage of those strawberries in that truck are inspected to be damaged in some way,
that's moldy here, whatever. Right? And it could be just even early signs of mold. The retailer
will say no. And it'll likely go to landfill or compost it best if it doesn't get through a secondary
market. And then you're at the retailer. And the retailer's not always going to sell through
everything. Right? So what do they do? They're going to compost. They're going to try and donate,
but the likely compost because donation takes additional energy in time. So for us, ideally,
through that chain. And I haven't even gotten to households. So households by the way, are
we're actually the worst at it. 40% of our waste in the United States is due to households.
We can touch upon that later. At XV decide to focus on just everything upstream from households,
because that's plenty to focus on. And ideally, if I is a farmer,
grew these strawberries for you, Astro, to eat. My hope would that end up in your belly.
Right. And every strawberry that I buy, I am presumably having to pay for all of the waste. Yes.
So my strawberry, I'm like kind of buying three strawberries, even though I'm eating one,
because two got wasted along the way, even though I didn't sign up. Exactly. Exactly. And as a
farmer, it's a little sad if two out of three strawberries, I intended for you to eat and
end up in compost. Right? So it's a very lossy system. And it's fascinating because I
started out my life as a mechanical engineer. And when I'm on an injection molding line,
I'm like if the yields are, if I get even 3% waste out of my injection molding line, I'm like
something's wrong. I got to fix that. You have a system that's 40% lossy, like literally 40% of
the food that we put through our food system in the United States ends up not in our bellies.
It's a shocking amount of calories that just never ended up where they intended to be. And so
anyways, ultimately, the highest and best use of any surplus food we have, that's edible,
is to serve its intended purpose, which is to end up in somebody's belly. It's hard. It is hard.
So talk us through, I remember one of the other challenges was, if Walmart has a gallon of milk
and they're pretty sure they're not going to sell it. And they wanted to donate it and they have
the the energy to send it somewhere else, which by the way costs money. But even if that's all
true, one of the things I learned through you in the team was, where does it go? Like if you take
it to a food bank, they might literally not have a refrigerator. And so then what's the point
of having taken milk there? It's just going to go bad at the soup kitchen or you might send it
to a place that has a refrigerator, but they've got too much milk. That's right. But there's no
way to throw, which places have a refrigerator or which places have too much milk before you send the
milk. I literally am crying over spilled milk right out thinking about this. So one of the things that we
did while we were here at X was start to think about, what does it mean to have an air traffic
control system for surplus food in the United States and the world? Because there's actually
four times as many calories grown in the world, a vegetable food, then we actually eat. So learn
as well that extra food go. And to your point, the communication system is right now for moving
food surplus to its highest best use, ending up in somebody's belly, are a little old school. They're
not old school in a bad way, but the way it currently works and most donation and food donation
works is that the person with the surplus calls up their trusted friends, literally with a phone.
Hey, do you have some milk? Yeah, do you want some milk? Oh, you don't do want some milk?
And they like 12 times later you might, oh, so it's so wants some milk, but, oh crap, I don't have
time to like move it there, right? So it's just really interesting challenge of communications,
but also logistics. How does it get there? Yeah, how does it get there, right? So, you know,
as a computer scientist, you'll know the NAPSAT problem and the traveling salesman problem, right?
The NAPSAT problem is if I ask you to give me $5.32, how are you, you can come up with many
different ways of doing that, right? And then the traveling salesman problem is, who do I visit first
and second and third and fourth to be the middle school? And what order do you visit a whole bunch of
places to minimize the amount of time you have to spend right? Exactly, exactly. So with food surplus,
ultimately we created the initial sort of version of an air traffic control system along with our
friends at Corroger, which is the largest traditional grocery in the United States,
20 hundred stores, and a feeding America, which is the largest hunger relief network
in a United States serving 40 million people. And so what we did was really help Corroger
raise their hands at every store every night and say, we have these types of foods available
and start to match that with the local food banks and also pantries to quickly move that food
as efficiently as possible to the people in need. And it was imperfect and we learned a whole lot
from that experience and that became a set of open communication standards that are now being
used broadly in many different places. So let's dig in a little bit to that air traffic control thing.
I'd love to hear two or three examples of specifically how it plays out, how it played out
first at X, and now in this open source version of it that's now in the world,
how concretely is it helping? And then how how do you quantify like how much better is it?
Hmm. So when we started working on the air traffic control system, we were inspired by the work
of the Arizona food banking network. So what's really interesting about the US food system and
the, let's think about North American general, much of the food that comes into the United States
comes from either Canada or Mexico and it turns out the 75% of our winter produce. So vegetables
and fruits come from Mexico, right? We're in winter right now. So I think about this a lot and it's
really four parts of the country that that food comes through. There's four ports. There's two
in Texas, one in California, and one in Arizona. And so in order to learn about this sort of
choke point, we actually discovered this concept of air traffic control by spending time in the
city of Nogales. It was in meeting with an individual by the name Dana Yost, who was running basically
air traffic control in his head every day. And Dana at that point was with the Southwest produce
cooperative and looking to basically broker. So every day, because we have so much food coming
from Mexico into the United States, obviously you would also see proportional loss, right? And once
a truck of tomatoes gets driven across the border from Mexico into Arizona bound for some other
part of the United States, if the retailer says, oh, I already have enough tomatoes that
in the cell through last week, that truck driver is like, it's going to cost me way too much money
in terms of time and gas to drive this back to Mexico and find a home for it. And it will go bad.
So I'm going to dump it by the side of the road and literally literally. So you go down to this area
in Arizona, you will find it littered with perfectly good fruits and vegetables. And so this person
Dana Yost was the person who the truck driver would ask, does anyone want my tomatoes before I
dumped them? Right. And so he was trying to basically, like in his mind, broker all of these relationships
and consider all the probabilities of all his friends taking the food. And he would call them
according to a particular priority, knowing certain things about all of them. Firstly, in the state of
Arizona, there's a number of other food banks that he could reach out to. Then it was all the
neighboring states. And then it was all the neighboring states after that. And you call it,
air traffic control, but it's sounding more and more like a marketplace. It is, yeah, very inefficient
market place, right. And feeding America for a long time has had a marketplace that has worked
really well for, I would say, non-perishable foods. To give you some sense of how hard this problem is,
when it's non-perishable, you have months, right? Like a box of Cheerios. You got some time, right?
But if you have a bag of lettuce, oh man, like you may be have like 10 days to figure it out.
If not, and you have to make a decision within 12 hours, really, truly. And so Dana was...
Because it has to get to someone's mouth within 10 days. Yeah, right? And so Dana was basically
helping us understand how he and other, I would say, surplus locations were trying to figure this out
in their brains. And so a lot of this marketplace or air traffic control system. And
a marketplace, you know, we would have to sort of somehow indicate with like points or like
fake money or something like that. How much a load was worth to us. But a marketplace doesn't even
all represent the trusted relationships necessarily. So we call it an air traffic control system,
because he literally is saying, this plain land now, this plain takeoff now, this plain is coming in,
so I need to line them up in the sky in this way. And we were really inspired by what he was
doing with his team in their minds that we wanted to enable all these other people in the country.
So other states that have surplus, Washington State always has too many apples. We just, by the way,
with one of our partners, help them with the great apple recovery. And like, it's like,
I don't know, 14 million tons of apples in the country, just like, would go to waste otherwise,
right? And instead of each area of the country have their own Dana or had their own Dana?
That was the hope, right? And Dana was unique. And not everyone was as good as Dana doing it.
So we wanted to basically build an artificial version of Dana, right? Like imagine if there was
like a Dana LLM, right? Like that was what we wanted for everyone. And that was our first prototype.
So ultimately, what we learned along the way was the crux of what he was doing was
number one, really understanding relationships and needs, right? So he will say things like,
oh, the folks in Oklahoma will never say yes to it plants. So I'm going to never send the
made plant, right? Or, you know, the folks in, you know, New Mexico, you know, will always send us
this, but we'll send them that, right? So like, you think of it as a kind of a rules engine,
but these were unspoken sort of aspects of that sort of trading marketplace, so to speak.
The second thing is you need logistics, right? Just because you can say yes,
someone has to take the one. Someone has to take the load, right? Like moving a truckload of
tomatoes, a 30,000 pounds, and cheap, right? You know, you got to buy the gas, you got to pay the
driver, and then on the other end, you had to space for it. There you got 3,000,000 tomatoes, a lot,
right? And not every warehouse, not every pantry has the capacity for that. So at the end of the day,
it's a huge logistics problem, right, to figure that out. And so, um, what, the air traffic control
system that was inspired by Dana Yoast became was this set of standardized ways to describe the
food, right? And you say tomato, I say tomato, right? Like everybody was, you know, had their own
lingo, right? So we had to translate it, right? And another way was to figure out the, um,
how to communicate. So what is the, like, so imagine if Astro, um, you were friends with me,
and I was friends with Libby, right? You're, maybe you're not friends with Libby,
but you can trust Libby because you're my friend, and I am friends with Libby, right? So let's say you
sent me a description of your truckload of tomatoes. You would then trust me to forward a long
to Libby, but Libby would see that that reference came through me back to you, and then automatically
be able to connect that. But imagine if that chain was sort of franchises trust. Yeah, exactly,
but to encrypt and encode that in an efficient way. And so we ended up at the end of the day evolving
to basically enabling any organization that wanted to participate in this broader network,
to be able to spin up a node on their own server, and to be able to quickly implement with reference
code, these basic standard descriptions, and sort of enjoying this, you're trying to control market
things kind of thing. Exactly. So it's a little bit like how telephones, like proliferated, right?
It's like, if I, I telephone, I'm very useful. You have a telephone suddenly it becomes useful
because even when I can talk, but the moment Libby gets a telephone, she can talk to me or you.
So as everyone kind of gets more, the snowball gets rolled exactly. So we now have
parts of the feeding America system on this, including the Arizona Food Banking Network,
and there's seven food banks, and organizations like the Farmling Project, which has moved
over 300 million pounds of food, which is mind-blowing, without any tech, are also adopting this
along with other partners who are starting to set up their own nodes. And we're still early stages,
but there's enough momentum now in the coalition, and enough people who are setting up nodes,
that it is more than anything I could have ever imagined. And people give back, right? People give
back and updating our GitHub, you know, the code is evolving on its own, and sometimes it's one of
those things. It's like, I did not know the impact that our little team could have had until
years after. It's when they tell us that it was sticky. And I'm not necessarily working on this
every day anymore, but it's stuck, right? And it continues to do good. When you were just talking
about kind of how the air traffic control technology that you had started here at X has now turned into
more of an open source, and the community is sort of helping to drive it, you were talking about
how it's proliferating, which is amazing. In this country, can it be taken outside this country?
Is it already being taken outside this country? Yeah, absolutely. So even in the early days, we had
friends from other countries who showed up and asked about it. So, you know, there's a very
large grocery chain in Australia that I will not name. That was very interested along with Australian
folks who have stepped up. And there's folks in Japan who have sort of spent some time on it.
There's folks, I think, in the Bahamas of all places who have been looking at it. And so,
and in some of them have been looking at it specifically for meat in particular, which I find fascinating
because meat has a very large carbon footprint. There are others who, you know, are really focused on it.
There's a little company called Fusionware that is a timepiece of middleware for, I would say,
farmers in America who are, you know, running with it and have their own note because they see
the ability to give options to their customers to donate easily as one of their really important
features, right? So anyways, I see the same thing happening also with, you know, my favorite
folks at Refed. We built what we also helped them with some of their tech to really measure
food waste progress in the United States. The same model is now being looked at by many, many other
countries. And I will shout out thank you to the Balmer Foundation for your grant because that's
what's making it possible now to do all that work globally. So, you know, good ideas are like viruses.
They catch on. They catch on. Right on. We're going to get back to food waste,
but you were actually doing two things at the same time for years. And so I'd love for you to
describe the early vision of chorus and then let's get into, because you and I went back and forth
on which of these is really the moonshot and which of them is just an application of the other one.
And we went back and forth for a long time, which I think says something about moonshots in
general that they're not obvious at head. No, no, moonshots are never obvious. I think when we're
trying to do anything hard solving huge problems, they evolve, right? They have a life of their own.
So, chorus, going back to why it started out in food, turns out that a lot of food ends up being
discarded, meaning composted or landfill, because we are not sure about to your point, chain of
custody, right? So, good example of this is let's say going back to that truck full strawberries, right?
We're supposed to maintain it between, you know, 10 and 20 degrees centigrade, actually 10 and
15 degrees centigrade. So, assume that for a second, right? Let's say I was driving from San Francisco
to New York and I don't know, in Oklahoma, my truck somehow had a digital breakdown and we're
not sure that during those 12 hours, whether or not it was able to maintain temperature,
right, because the temperature sensor stopped working. We're trashing, we're trashing them all,
right? And so, I have been told, even in the United States, we definitely have spots where the
connectivity is not great, where, you know, truck drivers could have their trucks break down and it's
literally a four hour walk to where they can get some sort of cell signal or Wi-Fi connection.
And so, chorus was intended to give, starting with food, everything of voice, so that the thing
could raise its hand and say, hey, I'm here and in the last 15 minutes, I'm getting awfully close
to my limit in terms of being too hot or too cool. So, whether this was a carton of strawberries
or a jug of milk or a vaccine or whatever that is, but anything that's sort of moving through the
world, how can it say, here's where I am and here's how I'm doing exactly. And here's the crazy
thing we discovered. So, we knew chorus because it required both soft one hardware would
take a lot of capital to get up and running because when you're building things, it's always
more expensive, right? Software is a lot easier to move forward with. We actually went to Japan to
study the fishing industry because fishing particular, yeah, again, I get sick, Astro, every going to
eat fish that has been properly, improperly stored. And for the longest time, these incredible
sushi chefs had this thought, you know what, the best fish is the fish that you fly and
plane to me, right? Because it's going to get there faster and it's going to be more secure and
I'm going to be able to monitor better, but we actually tracked fish with the early protests with chorus
with scout. That was kind of our early sort of prototype name. Fish either traveling on a truck
from Southern Japan to Tokyo or on a plane from Southern Japan to Tokyo. And it turns out that the
fish being left on a tarmac at an airport on a sunny day, oh man, they're way worse quality than
the ones that were on a truck than tire way there. And so even in the early discovery process of
working with these prototypes were like, we've to bunk some myths, right? Again, going back to awareness,
right? Like, I course by giving everything a voice and giving it the ability to raise it's hand
every 15 minutes, every 45 minutes or whatever frequency gives us information that allows us to
intervene when things might go awry so that we could save that food, that precious resource and
really continue to be good stewards of all of that. And so you were running these two projects
semi-independently, but we were going back and forth regularly. You know, one view was chorus
is the moonshot. We should track everything in the world. And one of the subsets of everything that we
should track is food and food waste. And the other argument was, I don't know, food waste is the
moonshot. And one of the things we need to do in order to solve the food waste problem is track
things. And that's what chorus is for. And so that's at least how I remember us going back and forth.
That's right. And I think ultimately we decided to allow both to be sort of
at equal standing and recognizing that they will take their own course. And for me, one of the greatest
gifts was when the pandemic played out in 2020. We had already started looking at other applications
of chorus to similar supply chains to food, food requires real intention around temperature,
around tracking. So does fire my suitacles. And oh my god, one of the things that COVID vaccines.
Like COVID vaccines. Do you know that 30% of vaccines in general is pre-COVID
are discarded because of temperature issues. And it blew my mind even before COVID. So we were
already in Japan working with a number of companies there. And the team quickly pivoted to actually
really lean into the healthcare space because we knew we would make the biggest impact there.
And I'm so grateful for that. So talk us through then the evolution chorus stayed on at X. Delta,
the food waste effort moved over to Google. And you decided to move with it to graduate to Google.
Like I'm really curious why you know move with Delta instead of staying with chorus.
And then what happened when you moved over to Google?
Oh gosh, Astro, it was such a looking back four years. It was such an incredible time.
Moving over to Google was a fascinating opportunity to work with the social impact parts of Google
and explore coalition building. I moved with Delta to the Google food team. We were able to
start working much more closely with a number of industry partners like Kruger, like Walmart.
And also bringing our philanthropy arm within Google because hunger relief does require an investment.
My hunger relief does require not only capital to really support the food banks and
pantries for their day-to-day operations, but a lot of them also benefit from technology investment.
And we were able to work with Google.org and a number of other partners across the
company to provide some of the basic tooling that would allow them to
basically use air traffic control easier, right? And the collective investment in that space
was really powerful and unlocking some of the really important technologies that we had built at
X and prototype. So you're happy with how this is evolved since then? Yeah, there's this little
organization called Refed that has led the way not only in the US, but globally around research
in this space. It's come a long way. It's evolved in ways I never expected. I'm really
proud of the work that we also did and I mentioned earlier. The air traffic control system here
that we've prototyping built and demonstrated at X became something called open product recovery.
So it's an open source set of data and communication standards that are, it's not blockchain,
but it's blockchain-y. So the tech team that built it took a lot of the components of tech from
blockchain to really accelerate the chain of trust and communication. Because imagine I had shared
with you earlier, how do I get rid of this, you know, truckload of strawberries I can't sell through
normal means. I call up, told my friends, and then those friends call up, told their friends each.
And it takes like three days to do that. And this is really good. Right? So how do you automate that?
Right? And so we have dozens of nodes of this network now that are set up to
move food much more quickly, mimicking the trust relationships that already exist in this
broader network of individuals and organizations. So never really anticipated where these things
would take me, but it's been an incredible journey. In hindsight, it was very wise
that we moved over to Google because I don't think I would have had the opportunity to
establish probably the boldest public food waste commitments, any tech companies ever made,
do the philanthropy work that we did with Google.org, and create the open standards that we did.
Awesome. I'd love to hear a few of your both like fondest memories, silliest stories,
X, and in particular, I'd love to hear what are your top one or two takeaways for like what it
takes to drive moonshots and moonshot thinking? So my first and foremost, what are my favorite
well probably my top memory and there's actually a lot of reason for this. I met my husband like
50 feet away from here in speedy cutie in that room. My husband's name is Chad Roons. Sorry,
I'm totally embarrassing you again. Yes, Chad was the mechanical analysis lead on project
loon, our internet balloon project. We had a little group prior to dating called hackers.x,
so we would come in and play pranks. And one of our pranks was we just thought that our security
signs here were a little boring. And I adore what you did. They were so boring. And they're not
boring anymore. And thank you, Emily. I know. So Chad and I for whatever reason, this was one of
those pranks where we had a group of four or five folks. We came in, we had like a big box of these
security signs. So we made them really funny. So there are things like you are now leaving a secure
area. Go back to thinking 1x, right? And so 10x, right? Or like you are now leaving, you know,
employees only from this point. And there would be something funny about it. Unless you're
bono. Unless you're Harrison Porter Bono, then it's fine for you to be here. And we only expected
them to last for like a day. We thought they would get taken down. This was like eight year, maybe
longer than that. But yeah, I'm very proud that they're still up. Very appreciative of you.
But x was this place for me where we could play. And you could find
kindred spirits and other people who we could play with. And I think when we work on really hard
problems, we have to approach them with joy and humor. And a spirit of it's okay if it doesn't
work because the journey to doing anything hard, like to remember there's this map that we did,
remember the one like it's like, you start and it's like, oh, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be
easy with the pit of despair in the world. And there's like a giant pit of despair. And if you can't
have fun, you're gonna like just like flail in the pit of despair, right? And the way you kind of
cross the pit of despair is when you're with others who you can you can play with. I'm so glad
you brought this up, Emily, because I knew exactly what you meant. But it's easy to hear when you or
someone else says, we got to play. And what gets taken away is, oh, it's just a playground. They're
not serious about what they do. Whereas, in fact, I think what you and I and everyone else here
feels is, we're so serious about this hard work. We know that seriousness is not the way to do it.
And so we're serious about the outcome, but we're playful about the process, not because we're not
interested in winning, but because we know that for a journey like this, being playful is actually
the way to maximize the chances of something really valuable happening. Yes, 100%. And if I go back to
that pit of despair, we have to truly love being with each other. And when we play, we learn about
each other, we learn about each other as human beings in a way that doesn't necessarily happen
if we're just about work the entire time. I think for all of us alums, X infused us with something
very special. That continues to live on, right? We might not be here every day, but it continues
to live in us. Thank you, Emily.
