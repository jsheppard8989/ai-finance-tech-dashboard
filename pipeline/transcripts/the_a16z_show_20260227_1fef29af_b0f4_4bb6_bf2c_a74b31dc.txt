This episode is from a recent A16Z all-hands meeting where bed floor widths, Mark and
recent deny, discuss the firm's new media strategy.
We cover why the old media playbook no longer works, why be interesting matters for
it being inoffensive, and how speeded it on the toasty have replaced polish and cautioned.
Really stoked to be making this happen.
Today's gonna be a fun one.
We're gonna dive into all things new media.
First start with a high level conversation about what is new media, how the media industry has
changed, and then get into what the new media team is doing here at A16Z, what we've done so far,
what we're focused on and where we're going in 2026.
But first we thought we'd start with a little sizzle reel that gives a little bit of insight into
some of the activity that we've done here.
So they pitched to us this idea of working with a virtual production using Marvel's
scene.
And we look at the calendar, the virtual crazy idea.
There's unlimited channels.
And then the brands are mostly people.
If you grew up in market, you're a whole concept of the laws of physics is different.
You have to approach new media with new media thinking new media people that kind of think.
But the world of media is completely different than we started.
You see the market themselves.
There's absolutely a manufacturer in the country in the house for actual law form,
the television commentary.
Few want to do something larger than yourselves and make the world a better place.
We are 100% for it.
One quick story I want to tell is to the video that we put out for the fundraising
announcement, which is a third most popular post ever on the last night before putting it out.
We had trouble getting one of the rights cleared for one of the songs that actually was like
the backbone for the video.
So the team using 11 labs recreated a different song that I think was actually better.
But it was a sort of an amazing last night's sprint to make it all work.
And I want to start there with the fundraising announcement because Ben you had this quote,
which I think summarizes one of the main principles of new media.
I just want to read a small part of it and then have you elaborate old media's defense oriented.
In new media, offense is always better than defense.
We've spent many years fretting about our results being leaked.
Old media tries to please every audience.
Old media is terrified of upsetting people and new media only cares about being interesting.
When in doubt, flood the zone.
Yeah, yeah.
That sounds like something I said.
One you share some of the tenets behind that idea and how you came to it.
Yeah, so actually it's interesting.
It's a really weird adjustment going from, you know, I mean, I spent my whole career in
media or dealing with old media and now we're in new media in the history of the firm.
The one thing that we really, really, really, really defended against was basically leak results.
And the reason and it goes back to, in the pretty early days of the firm,
the New York Times got a leak of our results.
And I mean, we were like a young firm.
So most of the funds were like a year old and venture capital firms don't have
high returns in the first year because nothing happens in the first year.
It's not like a stock market type thing.
And so they miss our, maybe it's the Wall Street Journal.
It was one of the two, but they miss interpreted the results.
So they kind of said, well, the early funds were good because those had enough years to get
kind of returns to them.
But funds ring was terrible and like, you know, that it had been so forth.
And because old media was still powerful, it was very hard to combat it.
You know, we put out statements in this and that and the other blog posts explaining like why they were wrong.
But it didn't land.
And it was such a like an inside the firm.
It was such a big crisis that actually, I'm pretty sure biology quit because he thought we were dead
because the New York Times had just ruined the whole firm with that article.
So it was like that kind of existential threat.
And so we were very oriented around, okay, don't let anything out that could be misinterpreted
or this or that because you can never correct it.
It goes out there and you're never going to kind of come back from it and see more about
the flood the zone concept in terms of why it works and why it's so different than
what happened in the past.
So in the past, traditional heat, it didn't count if it wasn't in the Wall Street Journal
or the New York Times or like the Economist or CNN or like there were maybe eight channels
that could save something and then whatever they said was permany in that, once it was out there,
it was very hard to deal with and it would be top of Google results like the whole thing.
But now like Mark and I if we really had a problem could go on 30 podcasts all of which get
a much bigger audience than any of the publications I talked about.
And we wouldn't have to talk about that. We could go talk about something else more interesting
and erase that from everybody's memory very quickly. So it's just without commenting on
what's about a world like the laws of physics are completely different in this world than the
other world. And I think to be effective as an organization in marketing and media,
you have to embrace the new world because you can't be half in half.
Because the whole motion of the old world will kill you in the new world.
Yeah, and vice versa. And so you have to kind of commit to
we're going to really care about what goes down through the old channels or we're not going to give
fun. Sorry to use language and we're just going to say interesting things and flood the zone
and we're doing the latter by the way. There's a whole history to this, but basically like the
whole idea that there's like a quote unquote corporate brand like the whole idea that there's like
a corporate like trademark and then the whole idea that you like as a business you basically
load everything into that thing and that's that thing whether it's general electric or
international business machines or whatever. The idea that that thing is somehow abstracted away
from the people involved and then that the people involved there main job is to try to kind of
buff that thing which kind of led to this, what do we look at it is like it led to this like 80
year kind of rain of everything being synthetic and plastic and boring, right? We're like
better than I've had this experience for many, many decades at this point. It's just like the
job of a corporate CEO for very long time was to get up on stage and to say absolutely nothing.
In any sort of public event, I actually was on a board of the CEO who very firmly
believe this and he literally would come off stage having very deliberately set absolutely nothing
and would have been thrilled because like he had made no news like mission accomplished, right?
Anyway, so the Eric to your question like basically I think the retrospective view on this
what happened was basically in the past, your communication channels were just like super narrow,
right? And so how could you get a message through to the mass market or to your audience or
to your customer base? You could only do it by kind of sending in a message that was encoded into
a few bits as possible, right? Because that was kind of your only shot because it was always limited
by TV broadcast near a time or was limited by newspaper column inches or whatever. And so you
just you had to kind of crystallize everything down to this kind of minimal and sort of at least
offensive kind of possible position. But it's always been unnatural because the human beings like
it never felt right. I always felt like weird because it's like this corporation is like this weird
other kind of alien thing. It always felt weird and uncomfortable and we just kind of got used to it.
And it just turns out as a friend of me famously said corporations are people too, right? And like
right. Yeah, he was using in a different context. He was not calling the change in PR. But for our
purposes, it's like it's all about people. It's all about the decisions that people make. But
it's a bit company or a government agency or a nonprofit or a venture firm or a startup is like
making decisions and acting in the world. That's people. Like there are some set of people who are
sitting around making that decision. And then it's kind of this almost not even like shock therapy or
something where it's just people who are actually making the calls actually show up and talking
there on behalf and explain themselves and actually say what they think it like blows everybody's minds.
Right. You know, it's the response people have to eat a lot and it's for response people have to
certain other people who are now kind of very notable environment who are running large things
who are very public and vocal. It's just kind of a single hand. It's just almost like this thing where
it's like, well, they can't say that. It's a wait a minute. Number one, they can't say that like they're
allowed to. They're like an adult in the United States of America. They're allowed to say whatever they want.
Number one, number two, how about they actually tell us what they think? Like how about we hear
directly from them so that we can actually understand what they're thinking and who they are
and how they're processing reality and what their assumptions are. And of course, the technological
cost for this is just that that narrow media funnel just got like completely blown into
the rings. Right. In large part as a consequence of all the work that all of us have done
on this call over the last 30 years. And you could kind of maybe say love it or hate it like the
days of kind of this narrow channel narrow casting. And then what I would argue is just this like
inherently deceptive practice of abstracting things away from people that world is just clearly fading
and in the new world we're just going to hear direct from people. I look, I'm not a utopian and
it's not going to be like 100% better, but I think there's no question it's a big net improvement.
Yeah. And by the way, the other thing that's really interesting and retrospect is
the things that people got in trouble for canceled for fired for, etc. in the past that they said in
the press were all just missing interpretations. You know, with somebody saying something and
because it was so narrow and because you could never erase it and because you could never come back
and defend it because the audience would be at thousands of the size on the defense.
You know, it wasn't, I said what I thought and people thought I was a horrible person. It was
like said something, it got misinterpreted and people thought it was a horrible person. So now in
this world we're like, you know, people say much more like aggressive things I would just say in
terms of, you know, not being mainstream thinking, but have room to explain it. That really happens
anymore. So I mean, everything from like Howard Dean to you know, you name like in today's world
that that would be nothing. But in that world because there was no chance to say, well, like this is
what happened. You know, like there were just thousands of times when people got into
incredible trouble for things that they said that were misinterpreted that they could not correct.
Yeah. And Eric, you know, Ben, Ben gave me good advice. You know, actually before you came
on board, which I am trying my best to stick to, although I will tell you what it's a significant
personal challenge. I can't, was not eating an entire box of Oreos and drinking an entire bottle
scotch every night, both of which I'm also trying not to do. Um, because we live in a healthy world now.
So, um, let's self-destruct a world. So, you know, Ben, Ben pointed out like, the, what Ben just said
basically applies into the new world actually just as much as the old world in the sense of like
when every time I've got myself in a like serious trouble, like in public over the last decade,
it's because I tweeted something. Um, and I mean, you know, everybody on your probably know
so much, I love Twitter and like it's great to be able to rip off the 100, you know, and that was
really good at like compressing something super controversial in 140 characters and then really
letting it rip up 280 characters. We've been pointed out like, look, every time every time somebody gets mad at
you, you know, we're just just like completely ripped it. You overs over that. Missy what's happened is it's
out of context. Um, and so Ben said, it's like just say everything that you think, but say it on a podcast,
right, say it in the context of an hour and a half discussion so that you can, whatever it is,
you've surrounded it with the full explanation or say it in the form of an essay where you've
like fully articulated your argument and it's fully in context. Um, and just observationally like
and not just applying to myself, but just more broadly, it's actually interesting if you watch this
to this day. When public figures get blown to some of the reins, it's almost always because of
something that's basically too short. Um, uh, when people actually do the full long, long-form explanation
of what they think, even if it's on a highly contrary, you know, even if it's imputed to be
out of controversy or whatever, if it's the full explanation, it is actually harder to blow people up
and again, you could kind of, it's actually really funny. You know, when I was a kid, like, you know,
the moral panic was around television, right, kind of pre-the internet and the moral panic, I tell
a lot of moral panic and television always was around the concept of sound bites, which is you
only ever get to hear like five seconds of what anybody's thoughts are, right? And somehow television
is now the gold standard, you know, for information transmission, the internet's evil, like somehow
it all flipped, but anyway, the point being is like the internet gives us the chance to not only express
ourselves, like, in short form, the internet specifically gives us the chance to express ourselves
in one form, right, and fully explain things. And that's, that's just so different, like the, the, the,
the hour, hour and a half, two hour discussion with somebody who's like deeply into something
and it's really involved in something, like, yeah, man, we all experience this as consumers,
like it's just so much better than the, than the 30-second death that, you know, might have been
on the NBC nightly news 30 years ago. And by the way, you know, the long form, uh,
of almost anything that's interesting, complex systems problem, um, which is most everything
in politics and in technology, you need the long form. There is no sound bite that gives you any information,
and so you have to have a long conversation. So it is actually much better, or it is for me,
as far as to get what, then there's always that thing with sugar, you know, using bones or whatever
to be wider than that kind of thing. I'm going to eat a gigantic package,
worrisome night in Deborah's honor, I really appreciate it. The, yeah, it's, we've also talked
about, you know, media training of the past used to be around, you know, how to stay out of trouble
this kind of thing. And now, you, you know, if you're a CEO, you want to be, you know, something
uh, you know, Jordy from TVPN as it's concept of a Joe Rogan CEO. I used someone interesting
enough to go on Joe Rogan for three out, you know, someone like an Alex Carp, someone like a Palmer
lucky, right? And, um, is in, and the flip side of that is that, you know, if you're interesting,
you know, if you're powerful, you're, you're, because you're interesting, uh, because that's what
people, that's what people want to work for, it's, you know, people want to be customers of,
it's people want to invest in, um, and if you're powerful and interesting, you're going to be
and, and, and that's something that you guys have also helped me get more, more accustomed to,
is like, hey, you know, this is the big leagues, you know, and there are people, like, who are
going to be mad at what we're doing, and, and that is, that's, in some ways, that's a good thing,
that's, it's evidence of our, of our power and, and our, seeing this.
Yeah, no, I think that's right. And I think, you know, it's hard, it did, this is another kind of
crossover between the old world and the new world, because it's your corporate brand,
then, you know, you try and keep all the dust off the brand and, and, you know, try and be,
something that nobody hates, uh, I guess, for like about a word, and then, you know, I think,
in today's world, to be good at marketing, you've got to be interesting, to be interesting.
If you're interesting, and powerful, there are going to be a lot of people who don't like you,
and that's, it'll like that's a good thing. And I was very happy to see by the way, the
infrared piece, because we can get like a nice piece, um, like a subsection of the firm,
but nobody's ever going to write like a really nice thing about the whole firm. I think that,
you know, also, it's a, this whole new world is much better for founder CEOs, because to be a founder,
you have to have an original idea, and original ideas are interesting by nature. I think that
professional CEOs, um, often get to that position through very careful polyticking, which,
uh, kind of as the opposite, where you want to be uncontroversial, like nobody can ding you
right as you get to the thing. And you know, Mark and I have, uh, been on, you know, Mark,
much better than me, but been on large boards, where in the large boards, you know, when it comes
to picking the professional CEO, they're all about what's not wrong with him, not what's right with it,
or let's write with her. And so you get these very vanilla characters who definitely could not
go on Joe Rogan, and that, you know, is all to our advantage, because we basically deal almost
entirely with founder CEOs. I want to, uh, transition to one more structural mechanic, because it's
a segue into how we've built our team a little bit, and it's, um, this, uh, Mark, it's this
McLuhan quote, you know, if it's on TV, it's a TV show, um, and to talk about how the different formats
yield different types of content. Um, okay. You want, you want me to do it, you want me to do it?
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is the thing. Okay. So yeah, Marshall McLuhan was the great
media theorist of the, of the TV era, and actually his work has actually held up really well
and it's, it's, it's, it's worth reading. Um, but, uh, he, he had, he had this, this thing in air
air justice that he said, if, if it's on TV, it's a television show. Um, in, in other words, like,
basically, that, that, that, that, that, you know, as they were as he said, the medium is the message,
basically what he said is like, look, like, TV, TV is a specific kind of technology,
a specific kind of media technology, um, and basically, like, all of the questions around TV are like,
you know, is it, you know, it's, you know, it's all basically just like the only real parameters
length, like, is it a three minute news segment? Is it a 20 minute sitcom? Is it a 40 minute drama?
Like, there's, there's very little kind of variation in like what you can do, because it's just a
linear, you know, it's just a straight, you know, just, you know, broadcast video, you know, mass broadcast video.
And so he said, you know, basically the medium and it's first, you know, 10 or 20 years of
evolved, you know, basically the concept of what we now know to be a television show, which is basically
either a comedy or drama or a combination of the both. And it's basically a little story,
and it's a little story, the play is that over 20 to 40 minutes, and it kind of has to be a self-contained story,
because you don't know when people are going to watch it. And, you know, now they're doing, you know,
now they're doing, you know, streaming and doing serial stories, but, you know, television shows
properly generally were, you know, where the door of the thing was on one off, you can watch up and
sell it out of order. And so there's like there, they're, they're these very, like, self-contained,
little, basically, you know, plays, little stage plays, broadcasts on video, and then they're,
they're these self-contained little stories, and then, and then they need to kind of appeal to emotion,
because it's like an emotional medium, right? It's not like an information dance medium. It's a, you know,
it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a medium that literally puts somebody in your living room. And so,
basically it's, it's like these little morality plays, right, where there's, and there's got to be like,
good guys and bad guys, and kind of the very simplistic story, and there's like a few, you know,
a few mile plot twists, and then everything kind of wraps up at the end. And what he says sort of,
the consequences of that is like everything on television has to be a television show. And that includes
everything in the real world that gets talked about on television has to be turned into a television show,
right? And, and this is kind of, you know, the running joke of like following, you know,
I don't know, whatever current events are politics on TV right now, which is kind of running
joke, which is, you know, and either party, which, but it's just kind of like, oh, you know,
that, you know, it's, you know, it's time for the next season. Oh, you know, this is the new, you know,
main plot that's happening, and then this is the new secondary plot that's happening, and if you
watch CNN every night, you know, they're just kind of, you know, they're kind of just playing with these stories,
you know, kind of over time, the way that the way that a soap opera might, or that a, you know,
that a, that a, that a, that a, that a drama might, or occasionally, you know, how comedy might.
And so, so basically, we just like lived in a world where it just seems like everything's a TV show.
And it's, it's a world where like all the edges are sanded off, and everything is kind of very
smooth and professional, and everything is kind of within this very narrow band of what can be put into
these kind of little, little morality place. Okay, so Marshall McLuhan unfortunately is long dead,
but I assert that if you were alive today, he would say, if it's on the internet, it's a viral internet post.
Right, so like what's the native medium of the internet? Like what's the thing that, what's the
form of media on the internet that like rips and dominates? And it's clearly the viral post, right?
It's, it's the viral, act, you know, tweet, it's the viral TikTok, it's the viral Instagram,
right? It's the, it's the viral Facebook post, it's the viral substack, it's the viral YouTube video.
Like it's very clearly deposed, and specifically it's the viral post, like it's, it's the one that
really rips. And so, so basically, you're right, right? So my theory is if it's on the internet,
everything is a viral post, and then you just ask yourself two questions, which is like, okay,
what's the characteristic of a viral post? And like nine times out of ten, it's something like
really gets people cranked up, right? Like, on whatever topic, right? It might be on whatever your
favorite pop star said yesterday, or it might be on whatever, you know, the politician said or it
might be on whatever, you know, a business leader said or whatever, but like, it's something that like
causes people to like flip out, right? You know, and maybe some people flip out possibly some
people flip out negatively or something, cause people to flip out. And then the other thing
with viral posts that's really interesting is you can actually observe this in the data.
They have this really rapid rise, like they tend it, if they're going to take off, they tend to
take off within like 12 hours, and then they spike like crazy as everybody retreats or reposts,
and, you know, emails that are on talks about it. And then there's basically just like half
like fall off, we're like within 24, it's like 12 hours up, and then it's like 24 hours down.
And then 36 hours later, it's like gone from our collective memory. And the reason is because
another one has popped up, and it's taken off instead. And if you kind of take a step back and
kind of chart the media landscape that we've all been living in for the last whatever, you know,
for sure, five years, but you know, you can even say probably 10 years. Well, what we've
lived through is just literally just like thousands of cycles of viral posts. Okay, you know,
is this good or bad or something in the middle? You can have a big debate about that.
You know, I would argue, it's its own form of emotionality, right? It's basically things that
spike the cortisol, and so that, you know, it sort of things that are controversial, and so
it leans into that. But you know, the other side is things that are interesting, right? And then
the other part is, you know, the people get a vote of what goes viral, right? It's not just up to a
news producer, what shows up on TV, so there's that aspect to it. Another aspect to it, by the way,
is that stories come and go much more quickly now, right? And so there will be some thing that pops,
and it's like the world's biggest crisis in whatever sector is talking about. And it's just like
everybody in the world has an opinion. This is where I was using a while back, the the the mean
of the current thing. Like it's the current thing. Everybody has to have an opinion on the current thing.
It's the most important thing in the world. And then 24 hours later, it's like it never happened.
Because something else, right? And it's become the current thing. And then that leads to, you know,
the new version of the old time on our strategy of getting through media crises, which is like just like
basically, you make sure something else becomes the new viral post. You know, gets get something else
elevated into that thing. So that, you know, there's the there's this way to kind of deal with these things.
But but anyway, I just think like as long as the internet is the medium of choice, we're going to live
in a world in which this is what it, you know, this is the cycle now. It's like a 24, 36 hour cycle
by the way, the traditional media in the form of newspapers and television, like at least the way I read them,
is they're basically covering whatever was the viral post like yesterday or a week ago. Right. And so
right. And so there being driven by the internet viral post, which is, which, you know, which is why I think that,
you know, the internet viral post is the higher order thing. And I also think like that, that's not going to change. Like they
the whole long thing I can do on that. But like they literally, if you're a television, if you're a television producer,
or if you're a news editor, whatever, like you can't possibly move your organization fast up to stay ahead of these cycles.
And so what you end up doing is you end up chasing them. And that's, and basically the role of mainstream
media for the rest of our life is just going to be to follow the internet viral post.
Yeah, never said, funding joke on the daily show years ago where they were time to a newspaper guy
and he said, why do you call it news? You should call it old. That's good. He was, he was the
internet at the time of the managing editor of the New York Times. And he was in his office. And the
New York Times, you know, is expecting to get the glowing coverage on the daily show. And whoever it was
shows up in the office and says, says what Ben just said in the guy. And the editor is just completely confused.
Like he clearly has no idea what the daily show guy is talking about. And he's like, well,
like, what do you mean? And he's like, you point to there's like a pilot literally physical newspapers in the
guy's desk. And he says, like, look, it's all old news. And he's like, no, no, it's today's paper.
And he's like, no, no, it's yesterday's paper. Like I already know everything that's in that.
And so, and yeah, and like it's just basically like, again, what do they have?
They're very proud of this. They have their editorial process. They have their publication process.
Like they have multi-layer bureaucratic mechanism for, you know, all all the news is fit to print.
But, you know, it's at least a 24 hour cycle to figure that out. And I mean, you know,
24 hours later, the internet has already moved on from whatever the last thing was. And so it's just,
it's, it's a, it's another example of the dog chasing the car, except now they have to chase it,
like every single day, which might be why they're so upset all the time. Yeah, they are pissed.
You know, we've really made sure to hire people who really understand the platform. Not just how
the platform works technically, but also the vibe and the taste and the spirit of the platform.
And we've gone all in to start on on X because those are just where the most interesting conversations
are happening, where people are the most plugged in. And so I think that's what's in tech world is on X.
You know, like it or not, like our world lives on X. I'm just because that's also where all the
e book both the kind of AI researchers and the AI influencers, crypto influencer, like
everybody in our world lives there, you know, at least some parts. So we can't avoid it,
even if we didn't like it. Yeah, where we love it. You're about to say something more.
Oh, yeah, no, I was just going to say, yeah, I know what Ben said is, yeah, so that like this is a
I posted a link to a book called the True Believer, the kind of talks about this is,
you know, the old characterization is elites and masses, which is a little bit 20 century. But
yeah, I like the people who are spending 24 hours a day trying to understand, you know,
basically in these domains like AI or, you know, politics or whatever, like they're on X. Like
that. And that's not the mass market, like that's not most of humanity, but like that's most of
the people who are like basically in the way you might, I don't know what you want to call, like
knowledge synthesis, business or whatever, where they're trying to like understand the formula
policies and things and so forth. Obviously, it's also true that TikTok and Instagram,
you know, have just like much more reach. Like they're, you know, they're just much bigger,
you know, they reach the mass kind of global audience more. And so that, you know, they certainly,
they certainly play a role. But if you're on the leading edge of the field, like, you know,
it's very rare that whatever is kind of the lead, you know, the edge of that process of kind of
idea formation, propagation, people, you know, in positions of authority kind of figuring out what
they think. That's almost all entirely on that. By the way, this is another huge
difference between old media and new media. So if you come from old media world,
there's just wreak, you know, right, like the targets, you know, if you were going for a target
audience, there was no real easy way to do it. All men mean, you know, like maybe like your sports
you'd be in sports illustrator, whatever, but like there wasn't really a way to do it. But now
with podcasts and and blogs and accents, when you can go to an exact audience,
you can really get down to an extremely narrow target, a new media world. And, you know,
for us, that's great, because the audience is founders, not the world. And so, you know,
having a way to talk to 90% of founders as opposed to 4% of the world is just a much better thing
for us. Yeah. The two more structural things, Mark, I want you to explain that I want to
present some slides, you know, give some detail about what we're doing, that relate to one
about to say, one is, I want you to explain the the void loop and why, you know, that that makes
to Twitter and social media so much more powerful in terms of, you know, forming consensus.
And then the other is the difference between written and oral culture and what's prioritized
in, you know, as you transition oral. Yeah. Okay. So these are both long topics.
And so I'll try to do the click notes version. Yeah. So I'll link to the book on this. But in,
in military theory, there's this concept called maneuver warfare, which basically just says like
speed, speed wins, like speed, speed wins is compared to math, math, math, winning,
speed wins. So if you, if you, if you believe that, then there's basically this frame, there's
this frame, or called called the Udolup, O-O-D-A loop, which originally was developed for
fighter pilots, and then later for, for broader military strategy. And the Udolup,
the, what, what O-D-A stands for, it's an acronym, it stands for Observe Orient Decide Act.
And so it's basically the decision making cycle, right? And so, and Observe is like,
view the outside world, Orient is like figure out where you are in respect to the outside
world. Decide, of course, decide what to do, act, act. And basically what this guy, boy,
came up with this idea said was like, any military operator, any fighter pilot, any military
operation, any, you know, basketball player, any, you know, company, any government,
basically goes through a decision making cycle that's like that in order to make decisions.
So we just talked about it in your times, has their own Udolup, it's like 24 hours to go through
their process, right? And so, and so, and, and as you what he said, it's like if, if speed is
a thing that matters, then the person who gets to the cycle of fastest is the one who's going to win,
but he said, there's a second order thing that happens. So one is just like, is Udolup
faster than the other guys. So, so that's one question. But he said, the other thing can happen is
if you, if you can have a sustainably faster Udolup processing cycle than the next guy,
then if you think about what happens, like, let's say it takes, you know, you whatever,
you know, an hour to figure something out, it takes the other guy to hour to figure something out.
And think about what happens is like, okay, you start out and even playing fields.
You, you both start your, your decision making cycles. You operate, you, you make your decision
within an hour. The other guy is still, say, it's inside his own Udolup when you make your decision,
right? And so, you make your decision, you act within an hour. He's only halfway through his process.
He now has to start his process over, right? Because, because you've changed the last
gap, you've changed the parameters of what's going on. So he now has to go back and re-observe
and reorient has started over, right? And then, and then, of course, project forward. It's like,
okay, then you decide again within an hour. And then by the time he gets, and again, he gets halfway
through his process, he gets interrupted. He has to go back. And so what he says is, if you,
if you can be sustainably fast for running your decision loop, you can get inside the other
guy's loop in a, in a systematic and perpetual way. And basically, the result of that is psychological
breakdown. Basically, you destroy this psychology of other side because they just simply,
they, they just can no longer operate or function at all. They just like basically go into
complete panic. Nothing seems to make sense. They can never get oriented. They can never make
decisions. They can never, they become completely defensive, completely responsive. You completely
dominate, you know, basically, the playing field. And he, you know, he was a famous fighter pilot.
He was a famous fighter pilot called 15 second boy because he, his claim was in, which was true,
as he could beat any other fighter pilot in dogfight within 15 seconds using this method. And so
it's basically this, this, this, this premium on speed and quality of execution such that
you are actually causing the side to have a, have a psychological break. By the way, like, again,
go back to, like, I think this is also a big explanation for what's happened to traditional media.
The, the fact that the internet moves events so much faster and this sort of internet collective
crowd decides what's important. So much faster causes all the people who were television producers,
who knew senators, who thought that they were in charge of the narrative to just basically
have a psychological breakdown. Like, how, how can you even function when the internet is just basically
cycling much faster than you could? And I think this, by the way, the same mystery of companies,
you know, this is what Elon does, you know, to his competitors like in the defense, you know,
in the aerospace industry. This is what Andrew's not doing in companies in the defense industry.
You know, this, quite frankly, is what we try to do, you know, to our competitors in the
venture industry. So, yeah, so that, no, to do that, you have to be willing to commit to being
fast, right? And so you can't, you can't have long bureaucratic processes, you can't have,
you know, a risk adverse posture, you can't, you know, stress, you know, you need enough time to
make a decision properly, you know, but you can't, you can't run the fully deliberate, you know,
strategy that a lot of companies used to have in the past were it was days to weeks to
months to figure out, you know, what they were going to say about something. By the way, in politics,
they adapted to this probably 30 years ago with the concept of the war room. And there's a
famous documentary in the Clinton campaign. And I think in 1988, where they called the war room,
they show this. And now, now they call it rapid response. And if you, if you go to basically any
political operation on the internet right now, you know, they'll have an exit count this literally,
they call it like rapid response. So, it's like, actually, the Department of War has won,
just as an example, the Department of War rapid response. And it's literally like they're responding
in real time to stuff that's happening because they want to stay inside, you know, everybody else's
Yeah, okay, so there's that. And then, yeah, the, the, the Oral versus written thing is it's
probably taking an hour to kind of go through the whole thing. But yeah, the long assured of it is
there, there's basically, in sort of human culture, there's kind of two ways to communicate. There's
two fundamental modes. There's oral communication, there's written communication. You know, oral communication,
you know, is the original form. And you could think about it literally as like people around a campfire
telling stories, singing songs, you know, reciting poetry. You can think about written communication
would be, you know, kind of famously the book or the scientific journal article, right, or the
math equation, or the business plan, right, you know, written artifact. And then, basically,
the characteristic of morality or oral communication is it's sort of inherently emotion first,
right, because it's, you know, literally, you know, live interactions to the other person.
The characteristic of written communication is sort of abstraction, you know, and then, you know,
hopefully logic, the scientific method, you know, intellectual rigor, analytical rigor.
It used to be the case that you can kind of really divide these, you know,
in traditional mass media, it used to be the case you could say that like newspaper some magazines
are written, and so they would be like more calmer and more dispassionate. You could say, you know,
television was oral, right? People literally people talking. And so it was going to be much more
emotional on how to headed, you know, basically like, you know, that, that's all broken down,
because of everything we've talked about. But the modern version of that is like the internet, like,
okay, is the internet and oral culture or written culture? And it turns out the answer is the internet
is both because the internet is everything, right? It supports every kind of media. And so a YouTube
video, I will say for sure, a short form, TikTok or Instagram reel for sure is oral culture.
Like, it's something short and bursty and emotional and interpersonal and it's experience,
a long form of sub-stack post is for sure written culture. But then things get more complicated,
because a short tweet, even though it's written, is actually an oral culture thing, right?
Because the fact that short means it has to be like this, again, the sort of this burst of,
of sort of, say, triggering emotionality in order to go viral. So actually, tweets, I would say
or oral culture, even though they look written. And then long form podcasts are actually written
culture, even though they look oral, right? Because if you're going to talk about something for
three hours, like that's necessarily something where you're kind of getting empty abstractions
and depth, you know, beyond just kind of a flash moment of emotion. And so the internet lets you
kind of play with these formats and the kind of impact that you want to have in a way that,
you know, in the past was kind of determined by exactly which fixed media you were in.
And like, we all live this. Like, if you want to have the internet experience of, like,
dim scrolling, again, you're really pissed off at the world. Like, you go to TikTok and
actually, you can do that. If you want to, like, learn a lot of stuff, you can go on sub-stack
and long form YouTube podcasts and you can live in that world and like, you can, like, you know,
raise your IQ point today. Like, you know, it's absolutely amazing. And so there is a choose
your own adventure aspect to it. And then, of course, you know, firms like ours need to
think hard about how we communicate because of the differences. I love that as a segue,
because it just emphasizes how different every platform is. And it's not, you know, a lot of people
or companies will just, you know, have one idea and then cross-post it, you know, across every platform.
But it doesn't fully appreciate, you know, what that platform is built for and what that platform
rewards. And so for every platform that we have, we have a, you know, with a sub-stack podcast, Instagram,
you know, X, YouTube, et cetera. We have an expert running it who is obsessed with, with that,
with that medium, you know, on Instagram, we're up 35% you know, month of a month right now. We have
this guy, Hero, who's 18 years old and has been, you know, grew up on an Instagram and it knows it,
like the, the back of his hand. And, and that really matters. That makes a difference. And so with
that is a segue, I want to do a share of just a few slides that just show a little bit about
what we've, what we've done so far. So what we're, you know, really trying to do is, is, is,
can make our companies, right? Is, is, is give them such a, a superpower in terms of getting their
message out in terms of reaching their customers in terms of reaching their talent. You know,
the superpower that companies like Anderall have to, you know, punch way above their,
their weight class and, and other brands, you know, wish that they, they had that level of,
of resonance, that level of reach. We're, we're, you know, trying to give them those super powers.
And, and we do that by, by building our own channels, our own, you know, media empire,
across platforms. We do that by making sure that we know everybody else who's got,
those, uh, some of the screen-posts for some reason. Okay, it's a great share.
But everybody else who's, who's got those powers of distribution and, and having great relationships
with them, um, and then also by just, you know, making sure that we have the expertise,
to be able to deploy, to, to, to our companies as well. You know, Lulu put this, uh, put this,
well, you know, that people don't really invest enough in, in, in people running these, these platforms.
And, um, you know, we've really, uh, spent a lot of time recruiting the, the right expert talent
to do it. So I'm, um, I'm stoked because now that we've had them build our platforms,
we're going to deploy them to, to work on behalf of our companies. Um, and so we're, you know,
casser from a plighted tuition, you know, he's, he's always been, I was an angel in, and
he has, there's also known for a while, and he's always been complaining of like, hey, you know,
why are we not valued more? Or why do we not have more resonance? Why do people, you know,
what, why is everyone talking about other companies, not, not our company, give it how good we are?
And I'm, um, is it a casser? You know, you've never tweeted in your life.
How do you expect to have tremendous, tremendous mind sharing? He, he finally, you know,
thanks to a lot of pushing that we did, bit the bullet, and his first tweet got like 4,000 likes.
You know, the first product we have, I'll get to in a second was, this launch is a service.
Um, the second one is going to be this, this founder go direct emotion. You know, we're working with
casser, we're working with Garrett from Flock Safety. You know, that's a heroic company that
should be at the stature of an Android as well, and, and I really helped them build that machine.
So, speaking of the launch of the service offering, this was, you know, inspired early on,
I was asking, you know, some of the GP's, hey, what would, where could we make the biggest difference?
Like, what new products should we have? And, you know, Sarah said, if we can get a guarantee of
viral announcement, you know, I think that'd be a superpower for us. So, so we built out this,
this launch of the service, you know, everything's souped to nuts from, from, you know, all the
all the social media copied, messaging, the, um, you know, the rollout, we created these custom videos,
you know, we hired Richard, another 18 year old who, you know, we convinced him to go straight
from high school at the NBA, I, not go to college, or at least not right now. And, um, he, uh,
he had previously done the clueless video, uh, and, um, and the browser based video, and he's just
got this, you know, phenomenal, um, taste for, for what really does well. And so we, we built this
video team Richard Ben, you know, Henry, you know, has really led this, led this product. And,
and you can see the, the views here, it's, it's, it's just, um, phenomenally well, um, you know,
millions of millions of views for our, for our companies, we've now scaled up this offering to,
to offer it to, to all, all of our companies. And, um, that, that's our first product, you know,
from there, we're, we're going to go deeper and do more embedded engagements, not, not just,
hey, let's get this announcement viral, but let's, let's build this repeatable motion to, uh,
to help companies, you know, build their foundations. And, and, and that's one thing I was
going to call out, um, we, um, after working with companies, companies are saying, hey, you know,
how do I hire people like that? In some cases, they were talking to them individually and seeing
if they were, they were potable. And, uh, we, we said, hey, we can't lose, you know, they say,
how do I find someone like Henry or Brandt or Richard or whoever? And so we said, hey, we want to,
well, first, we're trying to hire more of them too. Um, and so let's, let's, let's create this
fellowship. And then, and that's the new media fellowship was born to help us hire them, but also help
help our companies hire them. And so, uh, because, you know, there's this sweet spot where you need
to be online enough to really know the, the, the, the, the, the, have a taste and, and have a
sensibility and understand these new platforms. But, um, you need also need to be functioning enough
and professional enough to work at one of these companies. And, and there's not many people can,
can, can do both. And so we really, um, you know, tried to create this, this, uh, this program to be
able to identify these people and then just give them a little bit more sort of technical know how.
And so our first fellowship, uh, we, you know, 2000 applications, we picked 65 people. We think
we think they're incredible. Uh, we, two hires were must came from that so far. Um, and we think
this is going to be a franchise, um, to come. And, and then the other part of it, I'll just leave
is, um, you know, I think we were really popularizing this term, new media, seeing a number of
people with, you know, new media, JD's. They, they want to head of new media, they're, they're looking
for that. And I think we're, uh, sort of, in, in the way that we've popularized American dynamism,
other people have American dynamism practices. Um, we're starting to see that with, with, with
newbie. And so it's cool to, to see our thought leadership there. Um, and, uh, you know, more to, uh,
more to come. So, yeah, there's other things I'll leave you with in our, our, our, our presentation,
the, um, you know, our, our channels are up, um, tremendously. And we're continuing to invest in them.
We, um, we've got this portfolio offering launch as a service where we're, you know, now launching
our go direct motion of really helping our, our CEOs and companies do that. It has to come
from CEO. So every engagement we do, the CEO is, is tremendously engaged. Um, and then we're
really building out this, this new media category creation, this new media talent base for, for us,
because we're continuing to hire, uh, but then also our, our, our, our, our companies. Yeah. So
band, any closing thoughts? I'm, uh, I, I would just say that, uh, you know, particular
if you spent time in, uh, the prior media regime, um, you know, evolved media, you know, you
really have to rethink every instinct that you have because it's, it's one of the,
where it is things where all your instincts are wrong. I mean, we're actually experiencing a
little bit of this in AI too, which, you know, our team wrote a great post on, which is like in
the old world of software, the one thing you knew is you couldn't throw money at a problem. And
now you can throw money at a problem. And so like, you don't even realize how much of your thinking
is affected by that old rule. Um, and, you know, uh, I would say this is that in spades where,
like every single instinct you have is incorrect if you're in this world. And you just have
to let it all go. And this is why, you know, this is people, women, oh, like the right way
built this big podcast network and blah, but that's not what happened. What happened is Trump just
understood new media for whatever. I don't know why he did because he's so old and he's been an
old media the whole time. But like he just rolled right into it and, you know, not at a technological
level, but this media as a medium. And I think that, you know, we've got to do that. We have to
understand it and we have to kind of play by the new roles. All my favorite comedians, podcasts,
etc., always tell their guests, don't read the comments. What do you guys think? Do the
manic reddit posters drive you nuts? I have not dive into our podcast comment section, but I have
seen a 60 z region reddit, not surprising. Uh, for what is worth every 10 o'clock conference I've
been out all the day 60 z is always had an a 60 z fanboy raving about our podcast. Um, yeah, so Eric
read the contents and read the comments. Don't read the comments. Don't read the comments. If they're
going to affect what you say, it's kind of like the yelp prop, you know, people who care
enough to post either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. And we've definitely got at this point
I, I, it doesn't affect me. So I read the comments, but you know, I, you know, I, well, you know,
and Marka Ben have helped me not to not get too concerned about some of the, some of the commentary
on Twitter by, you know, certain anonymous Twitter posters who, you know, raging in their basements.
But, uh, yeah, ensure, don't read the comments. Yeah, so I'll just, I'll just maybe close
on two things. Um, so one is, um, uh, there's a long history of this. And so, uh, if you read any sort
of biography or autobiography of any sort of professional author, you know, um, uh, you know,
writes, writes books for a living. Like 100% of the time at some point, they will tell you,
oh, the one thing I never do is read, read the critics, right? Uh, I never read the reviews.
Um, and then they'll say, well, actually, no, that's not true. I always read the reviews.
Um, because I know I shouldn't, right? Like, I know I shouldn't. I know I shouldn't, because like critics,
like my definition are like, you know, basically bitter, you know, bitter people, um, you know,
who are, who are writing novels or whatever. And so of course, they're going to be mad.
Um, and, and I know I shouldn't read. I know it's very bad for me, and I was going to really screw me up.
And, and, and, and, and, and then I, I try and then it's like a magnetic pole. I, I always end up reading them,
you know, because it's like three in the morning and I can't resist them. And then I always end up getting mad.
Um, and so that, you know, there is this push. And it used to be right only professional authors or
professional filmmakers or whatever had critics, right? Yeah, yeah, we're using now basically, right? The entire,
the entire world is a critic. And so I, I think we all, we all, we all, we all kind of have that. It's,
it's a little bit of a, it's a little bit of a push and a pull. Um, and so, um, that is, that is a,
that is a little bit a little bit difficult. Um, you know, I will say, I, I think maybe a thing to kind of bear in mind.
Um, I could resist, I posted a link to it. Another book on this topic, uh, with, it has a
great title called Kill All Normies. Um, and it's a, it's a, it's a book actually from like a decade ago,
they talked about like this kind of very angry internet culture, you know, the kind of developed after the 2000s.
And, um, because by the way, internet was not always like this, like in the, in the very, very early days,
the internet was so hard to get on to that the only people who were on the internet were like basically
super, basically like smart, super successful people. Yeah, news groups were really good then.
Yeah, yeah, like for pre 1993 news, news groups were like utopia, um, and then, uh, and then, uh,
and then sort of post-1993, things started going sideways, and then things started.
That the modern kind of cost to get in our culture really developed in the, in the 2000s and 2010s.
Um, but, but basically it's like, it actually turns out there's like a, a genealogy to it,
and it actually turns out like a lot of it is literally, literally, it's, uh, it's like,
call of duty lobbies, um, uh, for online gaming. So it's like literally like online gaming lobbies,
because like when the Xbox and the PlayStation, you know, kind of rolled out, uh, voice, uh,
you know, voice interaction for the first time, you know, they're like, oh, be great for players to
be able to talk to each other, and it turns out you just get like, you know, 12-year-old boys in these
lobbies, just like torching the fuck, you know, out of everybody, and literally trying to get
under their opponent's skin, and then being willing to, you know, anonymously say absolutely anything to
do it, um, right, and so that led to, you know, you know, very, very, of course, very vulgar, very
offensive, you know, kind of thing, and then that, you know, kind of flipped, you know, that kind of
culture kind of expanded into early internet forums like something awful, and then it started
metastasizing and it things like, you know, like YouTube comments, um, uh, and then, you know,
and then obviously social media kind of blew that open. And so, um, there is this, um, uh, you know,
there, there is this kind of, you know, I don't know, like rage, undercurrent to everything,
um, and I guess it's just, you know, just got, you do kind of literally have to think about
if these are people literally in their, in their parents basement. And by the way, the other thing
is generally when we get attacked in the comments or, or, or stuff like that, it's somebody with
like four followers or like a bot or something like that. By the way, that is interesting to
read in the comments. Yeah, and that includes when it's hey, mantra, but no, yeah. Thanks for listening
