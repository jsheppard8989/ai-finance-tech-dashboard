Newer, welcome to the Denver State podcast.
Thank you so much for having me.
Well, this is awesome.
Awesome. Great.
So I was thinking we could start by just giving
a review of what orchard is, what embryo screening is.
Maybe what DNA is just a very, very basic triple.
Don't know anything about this.
And then also kind of what you're shipping.
And let's get into the moral case, right?
Why it's actually important that, you know,
if you're on the left and you believe in my body, my choice,
which I think you and I do, then obviously,
you know, you're going to want that to extend to everything.
And if you're on the right and you believe in deregulation,
decentralization, you know, like allowing people
basically a libertarian kind of view, then again,
you should come to this, to assist with that
idea that people's personal choices are their own business,
and certainly a parent shouldn't be forced to do something
that other parent or person wants it to do
is not really involved in their relationship.
So why don't we, why do we start with the first part
and let's talk with the technology and let's talk
with the morality and the society?
So you got some slides, got some visuals?
So what orchard is, is it allows parents
to protect their children in a way that hasn't been
possible before?
And what we're able to do is we're able to screen
the entire genome of an embryo to scan
for thousands of diseases that previously parents
didn't have the chance to know about until after the child
was born, after symptoms already developed,
after, you know, a doctor has a really awful conversation
with the parent that sort of ends with, you know,
there's not much that we can do.
So we basically give all of that information
at the earliest possible stage when there is actually
something that you can do, which is a transfer in embryo
that's unaffected.
So let's kind of start at the very beginning of the birds
and the bees, you know, how does embryo actually form?
So what does an embryo embryo is an egg plus a sperm?
Each egg, each gamut, you know,
egg and sperm are carrying 23 chromosomes
that combine to create a zygote and embryo that grows.
So you can actually see this is how an embryo develops
over those five days that it grows in the lab.
So what happens is that, you know,
it divides into multiple cells on day five,
you have about 125 cells, but I have of those cells
are sampled from the outer membrane,
which is called the trifectaderm,
and those are the ones that are actually used in orchids analysis.
So this process of actually biopsying
or giving a haircut to embryos has actually been happening
for over two decades.
It's just that in that, you know, five cell biopsies
that only have 30 peakograms of DNA, historically,
you haven't been able to get very much information off of that.
And you only got something called chromosome information, right?
Which you can kind of think of as like chapters in a book,
versus what orchids able to do is actually read every single letter,
every single base in those chapters as opposed to just that little thing.
That little thing.
That little thing is, this doesn't look, you know,
at the one or two or four or 16 cell or whatever cell stage,
it really doesn't look human, right?
It is very much, you can decide, you take a continuous process.
And every ethicist and every person will have a different point
on that process as to when it's a human being, right?
But like, probably most would agree that,
well, actually, no, some wouldn't,
that the sperm and egg are themselves, you know,
there's biblical injunctions against spilling one seed
on the ground and so on and so forth, right?
So if you think it's actually a quote human
at the moment of an embryo,
then you'll have one set of moral intrusions.
And if you think it's not really a human then,
but it might become a human three months or six months
or whatever months from now,
that's, you know, the whole termination to beige or have you.
Yeah, I think.
It's important to put this on screen because that way,
just put there, it really doesn't look like a human.
If you were, if you told machine learning to ask,
is that look like a human or not?
It's not, you know, it doesn't look like a human, right?
And whether it looks like something is on everything.
But it's something, you know, in the sense of,
it's a microscopic little cluster of cells
that it, you know, legal systems will differ,
based on whether or not you consider this
to quote be a human or not, right?
And many legal systems do not consider it to be a human.
This is like one of those things where it's like,
yeah, I totally agree.
I think it's like, it's very clear that, you know,
this is not visible to the naked eye.
It's, you know, there's no organs.
Oh yeah, and how small is it?
You actually, you have an indicated that on screen.
Yeah, yeah, it's not visible to the naked eye, right?
So this is under a microscope.
Like, you can't see this without a microscope.
No, if you were to see a petri dish,
you would not be able to see anything, right?
It's like smaller than a grain of sand.
But I think you, even separate from that,
like the question of, you know, is it, is it,
you know, human, is it not?
Like, the core thing is that orchid doesn't actually change
anything about the IVF process, right?
The way that IVF works, the way that it's worked for 40 years,
is that you extract eggs, you create embryos,
you create multiple embryos, and you have to choose
one to transfer, right?
So if you're opposed to creating embryos,
then you should just be opposed to IVF in general,
which is where, you know, 12 million plus babies have been born, right?
Right.
The thing that orchid is doing is saying that, hey,
you have these, you know, 4, 5, 6, 10, you know, 15 embryos,
have many embryos that you were able to create during that cycle.
And the question is which one do you transfer?
The previous method is that you transfer
with extremely limited information, and then with orchid,
you have the opportunity to have much more information.
So there isn't actually a new moral question
of should we create embryos or not,
or should we transfer embryos or not, right?
That question has already been decided by IVF,
and this question of, you know, which embryo do we transfer?
It's just inherent in every single IVF cycle, right?
If you create more than one embryo,
then that decision has to be made.
It's just that right now, it's made via kind of a beauty contest.
So what will happen is that an embryologist will look at these images and say,
okay, this one has a higher morphological grade,
this one has a lower morphological grade, or alternatively,
they'll use really limited genetic information.
So that's kind of chromosome testing when I'm going to get into it, right?
So, you know, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes,
and if you have a abnormal number of chromosomes,
then it's frequently not compatible with life, right?
So chromosomes are organized from largest to smallest,
meaning, you know, the number of genes,
the number of bases that are on chromosome one is much larger
than on the sex chromosomes are much smaller.
So most of, you know, if you have a monosome meaning,
a missing chromosome or an extra chromosome on, you know,
most of these chromosomes are just not compatible with life.
It's sort of unique situation where it is compatible with life
is Down syndrome, triceromy 21, and I guess the key point here is really,
you know, if someone asked you to proofread your book,
and the only thing that they could tell you is, you know,
your book has an extra or missing chapter,
you wouldn't really think that was a very good proofreader, right?
But that's really all that existing genetic testing can tell you,
is do you have an embryo as anyways?
Do you have an extra or missing chromosome?
So what holds you known sequencing and what or can
do is go much, much further.
It goes actually really deep into every single letter
in each of those chromosomes or chapters, right?
So any type of typo, whether that's an extra base,
an insertion, a missing base, a deletion,
those can all be detected.
So there's actually thousands of different
genetic diseases that have been catalogued by geneticists,
you know, in the academic community over the last two decades,
and you know, which really powerful is being able to actually
scan for these ahead of time, rather than after it's too late, right?
Like you probably don't know a lot of, you know,
the names of a lot of these conditions, you know,
neuro walkular disorder, like individually,
each of these conditions is really rare.
But in aggregate, if you add them up,
there are a lot of people are affected.
So, you know, if you look at like the rare disease community,
they'll say that, you know, 10% of Americans are affected
by rare disease and the vast majority of those are genetic,
the vast majority of those who are affected are children.
And 95% of these conditions don't even have treatments,
you know, much less occur.
So, you know, what's really cool is that this is already happening,
right? Like babies have already been born, you know,
through orchid that have been screened for this,
for units that have had their entire genome screened.
And, you know, the reason why this is really powerful is that,
if you look at pretty much every single outcome,
whether it's pregnancy or healthy baby, a huge component,
a double-digit component, is actually genetic, right?
So, if you look at miscarriage, about 50% of miscarriages
are due to genetic issues in the embryo, right?
So, there's people who have recurrent miscarriages due to genetics
that, you know, if they do embryo screening,
don't have to, you know, suffer that same fate.
If you look at infant deaths, you know,
over a quarter of infant deaths in the NICU,
then you need a intensive care unit, or due to underlying genetic diseases.
Again, this is like a huge category of sort of the maximum amount of suffering
that you can imagine for a parent and a child that could just be totally
avoided via embryo screening. And if you look at, you know,
another category like moderate to severe intellectual disability,
about 60% you know, there's a, about a 60% diagnostic yield for those folks,
and, you know, a large fraction of these are caused by what's called denovomutations.
So, that means that there's a new or spontaneous mutations in the embryo that are not present in the parents.
And a lot of these are paternaly inherited, meaning older fathers are contributing more denovomutations.
So, just to interrupt for a second, IVF already exists.
Inflintation diagnosed starter exists.
Yes.
Most people who do this, millions of people who've done this, millions of people are already screening.
And they're already screening for, for example, moderate to severe intellectual disability.
The cause, if you're actually doing it, why would you, you might not.
Right. So, so this screening, the moderate to severe intellectual disability,
this is happening in the pediatric setting, right? So, a child will come in and they'll be affected,
right, with, with either, you know, autism or intellectual disability or epilepsy.
And then geneticists will sequence them and find out what the causes, right?
The only difference is that instead of waiting until after symptoms happen,
we're, we're moving that timeline all the way up to the embryo, because now we have this new ability,
which is available to actually sequence the entire genome of the embryo,
other than just this tiny fraction, just the chromosomes.
Right. So, it's actually, this right. So, some fraction things can be caught pre-conception or even pre,
like, even before people are married, or what have you, because you can get, you can sequence
or, or carry a testimony, but many other things that are denovable, you can only catch post-conception,
but potentially post-conception, but pre-implantation. Yes, because. Exactly.
Yeah, and I think a really important piece here is that right now, the situation is that,
you know, we talked about chromosome testing, right? So, via NIPT,
pregnant mothers at 10 or, you know, 15, we could already getting information about
chromosomes, right? They're already finding out, okay, my child has Down syndrome and now they
have an option, right, which is either terminate or have an affected child, right?
They're already put in that position, right? And people are already choosing to terminate
or already choosing to, you know, continue those pregnancies, right? So, it doesn't,
it's, it's fully sort of more compassionate from a emotional physical level to just move that
timeline forward to the point of transferring an embryo as opposed to pre-implantation,
rather than post-implantation. Yes, yes, exactly. So, that's what's kind of really surprising
to just, just to define terms, right? There's like, you know, there's just screening an adult
and giving them their genome before they're, you know, having any partner of any kind.
Then there is, let's call it pre-conception testing, which is similar except the difference being
that now your genome and your partnership, you know, we're being analyzed together to determine
whether or not your children will potentially have, for example, a chance of having a double
recessive of both parents have a Mendelian disease. And there is post-conception when the embryo
exists, but pre-implantation, which is in the context of IVF where you've got the nine embryos,
for example, in your diagram and there are these tiny microscopic grain of sand things.
And then there is post-implantation when, you know, the embryo is actually in the mother's room
and developing and then you're screening, you know, that. Yes, that is. And basically,
she's just one of the levels different amounts of information are being revealed, right? So,
correct. That's right. Okay, we're only looks at recessive disorders, right? But we're saying,
hey, you know, you probably care about dominant sort of, right, you care about cancer, right? But
that's just missing from carrier screen, right? Say, it's working. Exactly. So, in a sense,
if you make a distinction in embryo and a three-month-old fetus, which most people I think do,
yes. By moving more testing, now, of course, IVF itself is a procedure in a significant one
and so and so forth. But if someone's doing IVF, then because you can screen pre-implantation,
you can catch things so that you don't have to screen post-implantation when there's,
it's actually developing in the womb. It's actually a more, as you said, more compassion,
a kind of thing. Yeah, exactly. Right? I mean, maybe it's obvious, but the main cost of that is
doing IVF in the first place. And that's whole separate topic, but we want to reduce the cost of doing
IVF. We want to, let me see, or hit, a lot of people are working on that. And I think, yeah, exactly.
And I think even to focus on IVF, right? So, we've also already resolved the moral question of
should people be allowed to do IVF electively, right? So, egg freezing and IVF are identical
processes. The question is just, you know, do freeze the eggs or do you actually fertilize the eggs?
But essentially, women who are perfectly fertile, they have no infertility issue, or already
using IVF using egg freezing prophylactically, right? Proactively to, basically, yeah,
preserve their fertility, right? So, this idea that IVF can be used electively
without an infertility diagnosis has actually also already been resolved for the last 10 years,
right? So, even that question of, you know, should people be using IVF who don't have an infertility
issue? I think that question has already been answered, right? It used to be the case that
egg freezing was only recommended for women who had, you know, cancer diagnosis, right?
They were going to be during chemotherapy, and then it was an option to preserve their fertility,
right? But, you know, over the last decade, it sort of advanced beyond that. It's no longer experimental,
yeah, millions of people have, have done, you know, that procedure as well, right? And obviously
gay parents are, are using IVF, you know, to form their families, too. So, I think it's really sort of,
I think at this point, it's already a personal decision. Do you want, you know, to use IVF
to form your family? So, again, it's sort of just like, okay, now, once you made the decision to
use IVF, how much information do you want? Do you want a little bit of information or do you want
sort of the maximum out of information that science can provide? Yeah, so kind of just moving on,
right? So, so I really wanted to kind of focus on this monogenic case because this is sort of, I would say,
you know, very clinically bullet proof in the sense that, look, all of these conditions are already
screened for in the pediatric setting, in the adult setting, there's no debate about, you know,
if you have this variant, doesn't lead to these disease, right? They're all considered definitively
associated with these diseases. So, it's really just about, you know, moving that timeline forward.
I would say the second side of the testing is using what's called, I guess, so, just to kind of
like hammer that point home on the monogenic side, right? So, we have users who've had, you know,
children who have terminal disorders, right? So, this is a child that has this brain disorder
called ListenSafely. You know, vast majority of children with this condition died before their 10 years
old. There's no cure. So, I think it's, it's honestly, I think quite cruel to, in any way,
stigmatized these parents, right? They've sort of given up their entire careers to be caregivers
for, you know, these very severely affected children, and now they want the opportunity to have a child
that is healthy, that doesn't have to suffer, for children, and it's in the same way that
their first child did, and I think that that's an extremely important, vulnerable population to
embrace, rather than to somehow stigmatize and I just feel, you know, extremely strongly about these
families. I mean, this is kind of like the reason why I started the company. So, yeah, I just think
if people understood what it is that they're going through, it's like a very human desire, right? The idea
that, you know, you want to, you know, see your child, you know, grow up, grow old rather than
having to bury them, right? And this is a very, this is the reality. All the people who are like,
just roll the dice, what about the people who didn't want to roll the dice and they got a very
bad role of the dice and very bad luck, right? You know, there's no point in, you know, just roll
the dice is just some silly type of thing that people will say without actually thinking about
the consequences of it for people they don't know, like, like Mrs. Crown over here.
Yeah, exactly. I mean, they're not on the hook for the, for the lifetime, you know,
of medical bills, right? And I think that, you know, it's not diminishing, you know,
you know, this baby's life or anyone's life to screen and to say, hey, for my next child,
I don't want them to be affected by that condition. I think that's kind of one of the tensions
that I think people somehow don't understand that, hey, you know, if I choose not to drink during
my pregnancy, that's not saying, all people with fetal alcohol syndrome should be deleted,
for me, for my child, I don't want them to be affected by fetal alcohol. Of course, these
arguments that the, some of these folks are making are just so silly because it's like saying,
you know, I think we should put on seat belts. So, I was in a car crash. Do you think I shouldn't
exist? Yeah, exactly. It's exactly the same as little lives. It's just me, you know, every one
is equally, I want to feel people to be hurt by car crashes, you know, yeah, exactly. And if anything,
it's sort of like even more unfair than a car crash because hey, it's like, okay, there was like a
clear human error, you know, 90% of the time for why that car crash happened. This is sort of like,
okay, you just a random typo, just, you know, got added to your DNA and then, you know,
you just, you know, your organs don't form, your limbs don't form, your skull doesn't form, right?
That's so it can just be very catastrophic. It's like the, you know, the, there's a meme about,
like, did you have breakfast today? They genuinely can't contemplate a counterfactual, fundamentally,
the, the concept, really what it boils down to, I think, is mystery-loves company.
People who have some form of bad thing happen to them, just want other people to all
to be miserable, some of them. Others don't, right? Why don't we go to the next slide to part.
Well, actually, I don't know about it. I kind of like, basically me saying something and then you
doing your commentary over it. Go. So I actually think that's kind of good. Like, do you want to do
this summary really quick of like, what all this means? I actually thought that was really good.
If you want to just, like, have one thought. Yeah. I mean, my summary is, uh, and by, we'll
add it in polar thinking. Yeah. Um, my summary is A, we've got to tell me an IVF, uh, babies. B,
we already are doing diagnosis priority implantation of IVF babies. C, we have opportunity to improve
that diagnosis by simply adding polygenic scoring on top of monogenic scoring. D, it's a parent's
decision as to whether to do that or not. E, it is not somebody else's decision really as to,
obviously, whether this parents got married in the first place, how they choose to have children,
whether they choose to have children, um, f, much of the hand ringing over this is based on bizarre
illogical, emotionalism that doesn't encounter the reality of what it is to have a child with
a genetic disorder and to make somebody else roll the dice of doing that. Um, it's, it's kind of like,
you know, I prefer a car without seat belts. Therefore, you must have a car without seat belts.
Yeah. You know, it's kind of like that you're literally preventing somebody else from taking a
precaution because you want to roll the dice. Okay. I mean, fine. If you want to roll the dice
be my guest, why should somebody else have to do that again? Why should somebody else have to do that?
Again, why should somebody else have to do that? Again, why should somebody's parents? I also think
you would be did if you just did one quick recap of like what are the moral questions here,
right? Which is like, okay, should we create embryos? Let's already finish. Right. So, so moral
questions. Hey, like should I should I should IVF be legal? Okay. And by the way, we can reverse the same,
you know, kind of argument. Do you hate all the IVF babies? You hate 12 million people? Do you want them all
to be eradicated? Because you're so anti IVF, you IVF hater, you IVF bigot, blah, blah, blah, right? Like,
you can reverse all these retarded arguments on them. Okay, fine. So number one should IVF be legal.
Okay. If yes, all right. Number two should pre-implantation genetic diagnosis be legal,
which it is, which is basically like, if you've got embryo. And by the way, you need that
because IVF embryos often have something, you know, wrong with their manipulities or something like that.
So, you have to screen them before implantation. So, screen them for anopolis, which are macroscopic,
chromosomal issues. Why wouldn't you screen them for microscopic ones, which are, like,
monogenic scores? And if you can do that, now that we've got the technology, why not polygenic?
There's really no, we're probably minimal at a cost. I assume the amplification step to actually
get the DNA from there and, and screen it. It's like, minimal biochemical at a cost.
So, let me put a like that. There might be fixed costs in terms of doing the data analysis
and so on. So, if, if, all right. So, if you're screening, should be able to do amplities,
almost certainly yes, monogenic, absolutely. That's always really standard if care and many parents choose it.
And polygenic, guess what? First of all, it's already happening. And second of all,
you can't, you can't draw the line for somebody else to marry somebody. So, they're already picking
the genes of the other partner. If they want a tall partner or a partner who's good at Frisbee,
that's already their choice. They're already in a sense of genes.
Yeah, that's the biggest impact on air embryos is going to be your partner. It's never,
it's going to be the case that your embryo screen is going to be, you know, it's 50% of the DNA,
you're choosing right there. So, yeah. So, you know, like obviously that's not role of the dice.
You're completely intentional about partner choice, you know? And so, this is just really,
you know, editing around that equilibrium. It's like plus minus whatever percent around that
50% that you've already got in there. So, you know, many medical procedures, by the way,
you know, hard transplants, there are people who attack that as necrophilia, right?
Actually, recently, you know, fecal transplants, which sound gross, have actually been really
valuable for people with IBS or other kinds of things fixed or gut microbiome.
Um, and, you know, obviously, there's a lot of people who are mad about.
The thing is, it's one thing to be mad, maybe specifically a best Pacific aspect of the COVID vaccine.
But a lot of people have just turned that into being against the germ theory of disease,
writ large. Like they generally don't understand coxposulids or transmission pathogenesis.
They just don't understand the immune system or have vaccines even work. And of course,
there's like, you know, stupidity on both sides, many sides on that issue.
But the point being that many medical procedures, if you're just described them to like
a medieval peasant, they'd be destroyed by them. They actually, yeah, it's a extremely
repugnant seeming, right? Like, um, boy, like, I mean, so first of all, just any organ transplant,
you could basically make the argument that, you know, if you break your leg,
then you didn't God want you to be, you know, unable to walk for less of your life.
Yes, maybe, but you could also say, hey, look, what do we put a cast on it and see if you can,
if it gets better? That's like the worst. Yes. So, like, for example, organ transplants are not
vs1, isn't that like defiling the dead or we have you, right? Like, you know, necratic, like,
okay, um, you know, blood transfusions, very similar, right? It was some of the
repudence would not actually be that wise. Um, number three, epidural, people used to have a huge
moral panic around epidural, right? That's right. Actually, doctors used to not tell somebody,
tell a patient if they had cancer. Yeah. Right. They would keep that information from, from patients.
It seems like a big deal. Very, very, very in-local apprentice, you know, type of thing.
Um, I mean, there's, there's so many things like essentially modern medicine,
you know, even hand washing was fought to the nail. Some of you used to have a huge problem with
that, like people didn't, didn't like him. Um, you know, many, many things that are innovations in medicine,
even the analysis of, go ahead. Oh, I was just going to say, yeah, even, um, you know,
during samples, steel samples, blood samples, you know, analyzing all that stuff, analyzing all those
fluids. There's a disgust reflex with that. Um, like a lot of medicine is gross, right? Like, if you,
you're a jury is gross, right? The idea of cutting someone open, fixing something,
jury is gross. All this stuff, of course, you know, you have, I mean, there's all kinds of blood
everywhere in the operating room on a surgery. If you're just walking on that, you're like,
you're hurting him, stop blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know, and, you know, you've been
understanding anesthesia. You know, basically these are just things where the intuitions of a
medieval peasant can only really get you so far, right? They really, the caveman mentality,
yeah, so sometimes there's a utility to it, right? Or sometimes there's something that feels
weird and actually is bad or heavy, right? But the problem, and one of the issues is, um,
that much of the modern scientific establishment has said, for example, like XX and XY don't exist,
right? Like chromosomes don't, don't, aren't functional and so on. So I actually understand where
the sort of medieval peasant mentality came from or why it came back because they just went back
to extreme basics and just relied on their intuitions as a caveman. But those intuitions are
going to be different from person to person also, right? So they're not scalable across the site. They're
very tribal. Yeah. Anyway, so, uh, it's coming back. So basically, I think what will eventually
happen with all of this by the way, and let's go back to your slides. But I think what's going to,
she, let's start it, yeah, yeah, go, no, no, no, go, you should. Yeah, I think a lot of people
really underestimate what the power of a base pair is, right? You know, you have ATCG, people
like, oh, you know, maybe it doesn't really matter if you swap an A for ATC, right? So I'm going
to try to really illustrate and show you kind of what the impacts of a single base pair are, right?
So this is, you know, the tallest men in the world. This is the shortest woman in the world. And,
um, you know, these conditions, um, you know, Gigantism and a Controplasia, um, are, are really
caused by, you know, a single letter change, right? So you're talking about a single letter, um,
in a single gene that results of very good slide. Green leads, um, you know, dramatically different,
you know, uh, you know, essentially what happens in Gigantism is that, you know, your
portraying system goes into overdrive and sort of a massive amount of growth hormone gets dumped and
you become, um, you know, extremely tall. And, um, you know, conversely in a Controplasia, um,
you know, people who are, who are much, much more shorter, um, you know, they have a critical,
protein that's broken that doesn't allow, um, you know, normal growth. Yeah. And actually, if,
if I were to call correctly, um, that particular variant is something that's more common among, um,
sperm of older men that it's like a hypermutable region or something like that that tends to,
you tend to see more a Controplasia in children of older men. But there's some sort of,
that part of the genome is actually more susceptible to mutation in that particular way,
which is, like, of course, I actually don't know, like, you know, the, the full ideology of
both of these diseases. I just think that, you know, when you're looking at that previous slide where
we're talking about, um, you know, these thousands of, of different diseases, a lot of these are,
honestly, our, our fail are extremely serious. People don't have an emotional reaction to it because they
don't know someone with, um, you know, arterial calcification or any of these, you know,
sort of diseases that have strange names are not very relatable, um, but I don't know. I guess
what I'm trying to get across here is like, you know, it really matters, right? It could be the
difference between your child having a terminal condition or not. It could be the difference between,
um, you know, someone, you know, being, you know, very, you know, three-centered deviations,
um, from the norm in terms of height, um, in either, in either direction, right? So, um,
these changes do matter. And, um, you know, it's very reasonable for parents to want to scan
for this information, because it can have, you know, a, a very significant impact on, you know,
their health trajectory. So, we kind of already talked about monogenic phenomenon again into polygenics.
So, again, monogenic is sort of that, you know, single gene, single variant, it's a specific disease.
Polygenics is trying to understand conditions like heart disease gets a frontier by puller,
where it's not just driven by a single gene, but rather it's the cumulative effect of many,
many different variants across that you know. So, you know, the study design, the way that they
actually, you know, build these models is, is pretty simple. They're looking for sequence variation.
They have sets of, um, people who are, um, you know, unaffected controls, and then they have
people who are affected. So, if you have folks who have schizophrenia, folks who have bipolar,
and then they're looking for, um, enrichment. So, um, you know, basically which variants are, um,
you know, more common in the, in the cases, as opposed to the controls.
And, um, in terms of the performance, um, this is what the shape of these curves often look like,
right? So, you're looking at, you know, how often do people get, um, heart disease and what is the
percentile of their risk score? So, in the 50th percentile, that's about average. And then what you
can see is that there's a really strong risk increase, uh, when you get to the, the, the, the much higher
for, right, the 95th plus percentile of risk, right? So, that's kind of what, the type of risk that
we highlight, um, it doesn't really matter if, you know, the 30th or the 70th percentile, because the
very small increase in risk, but if you're at the tails of these distributions, there is a very strong
signal from that, um, genetic, um, component. Um, so that's kind of what parents can learn. Is it okay?
Is my embryo in that low risk or average risk category, or is my embryo in that higher regard?
Yeah, the, the thing about, um, there's n variables on which you've got curves like this.
Whether they look exactly like this or not, because that is cornering our disease. You've got
n more that are like that. Yeah. And how do you, how do you, how do you think about the
multi variable aspect of that? Because some, an embryo that's high on some of these will be low on
others. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's actually, uh, a, a great, um, so I'll actually get into that.
Because you're doing best of n across a vector of k variables, or k is usually much greater than n.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think one of the things that people are really trying to understand is that,
you know, if I'm, you know, selecting an embryo, that's low risk for, for one condition does that mean
that they're going to, you know, conversely be higher risk for another condition. And they've actually
already built, um, what's called correlation matrices will, what, what they'll say. Okay, um,
is heart disease correlated with, isial for relation. Is it correlated with schizophrenia? Is it
correlated with bipolar disorder? They've, they've done this. Yeah, but you wouldn't, you wouldn't
need to do it that way. Because you actually have, if I'm not mistaken, you have actually the raw
underlying A, C's, G's, and T's. So you can form, let's say, of n embryos, and you have k conditions
on which you're screening for, and then each of those k conditions has, um, m sub k underlying
low psi, right, that contribute to it, which is a ragged list for each of them, right? Yeah.
Then you can, you don't have to do the calculations. You, you can actually go to the exact
low psi. You can say, let me calculate the PGS for this n by k table. Yeah. And then you can just see,
you know, how many shared variants are there? Yeah, you. Right. Yeah, yeah. So basically,
what I guess what I'm getting at is like, what you see is there's, there's an aggregation with
diseases that have that are related to basically heart related conditions, you know, heart disease,
ageal for relation. Those aggregate together, they have a shared architecture,
uh, mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia. They aggregate together,
right? So what ends up happening is you get to actually reduce risk for multiple conditions at
once, right? So an embryo that's, um, you know, high risk for schizophrenia is also, um,
you know, likely to, there's, there, there, there, there is a shared shared architecture for
other mental health conditions. So, um, rather than there being a trade-off, what I would actually
happen is that a lot of these conditions that are for similar, um, systems end up actually,
um, having those, those shared variants. So, um, anyways, I think that's, I'm trying to,
kind of, just kind of respond quickly to what people usually, they're sort of immediate,
and how many conditions are you looking at there besides coronary disease?
Uh, we're looking at about 12. I'm going to give you the, the, the full list, but kind of,
thinking about this, you know, sort of like the South Asian standpoint, right? If you roll the dice,
you might get an average outcome, right? So, what if the average outcome is chronic disease,
right? So, all South Asians, we get heart disease at, you know, four times, uh, a higher rate than
any other ethnic population, right? Yeah. Or, um, twice as likely to, to die, you know, 25% of heart
attacks, um, occur under 40 for South Asians, uh, and 50% occur under the age of 50. Um,
so we're getting heart disease 10 years earlier than the rest of the population, right? So,
I don't want that to affect my child, just because that's something that, you know, a lot of South
Asians have that doesn't mean that I want that to, um, you know, automatically be a part of, you know,
that these are one of the biggest causes of death, right? Like, and especially in terms of, um,
you know, reducing the quality of, of life, right, a heart attack, even if you survive it, it's sort of,
you know, you, you, you are able to run as, as often a lot of these consequences of this, right? So,
the idea that parents shouldn't have access to mitigating the biggest vector in terms of mitigating
risk for disease, um, yeah, I just, I just think it's insane, right? Because, um, what you, what you
can see about, you're just talking about, okay, you know, um, what are, you know, when you're
trying to quantify, like, from, like, the math perspective, um, how much risk reduction is actually
possible. And, um, it's, it's really, uh, remarkable how much, um, you can get with a really small number of
embryos. So, this is looking at kind of the worst, um, worst case scenario, right? So, let's say you have
two parents, both mom and dad are at high risk. Um, and what you can see is that you can get a 30%
risk reduction with five embryos with, um, you know, a pretty, you know, poorly performing, uh,
model. And if you're in, and this analysis, by the way, you know, wasn't done by
workers done by an independent, uh, statistical geneticist, um, who just published this paper that I,
just loved, these, these figures that, um, he produced. So, then, you know, if he is a subtly
better model, he get a 40% risk reduction with five embryos, and then, uh, then even better model,
you get a 55% risk reduction with just five embryos, right? So, this is, you know, it starts
topping out with a second. So, the software again is the difference between the triangles,
the circles, and the squares. Yes, yes. Okay. So, just, and then, once you get to about
nine or so embryos. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're seeing this, this behavior
research is a flatten out, right? Because he sort of sampled from the distribution in terms of how
much, um, risk you can reduce. On, on one condition. Yep. This is on one condition. Right. But
multivariate, the problem is, if you're optimizing the minimum risk on one of your 12 things,
the other 11 are loose and can have higher risk, right? So, you have some
weighted sum of them that you're doing this on. Well, this one, this one is not looking at all.
Oh, we can look into the methods, but this figure specifically is talking about reducing risk
for one condition. No, I know. But basically, you would have this kind of figure for each of the 12,
but reducing risk for let's say you picked the best of five that got you the lowest risk on
condition one, right? Yeah. Then condition two through 12, you might have higher risk. So,
you have to sort of spend your optimization budget. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Exactly. So, so the thing you
want to think about is that probably for those other conditions, if you're playing in this realm,
it's not going to make a big difference. So, you really want to be focusing on what is the condition
that your embryos are at higher risk for, where there's a really big delta, you know,
right, you want to just get them out of that like 97th plus percentile, which usually for 12,
and if you're not going to have multiple, where you have embryos, like if you're not going to have
for multiple diseases that you're in the top 3 percentile of risk, if that makes sense, right?
Because if you're playing, that's kind of, does that make sense to explain that with?
Yeah. Totally. Keep going. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. So, basically, this is kind of like the worst
case area, right? You have, you have, you're pretty constrained because both mom and dad are
high risk, and you still get this pretty massive, right, 30 to 55 percent risk reduction, right?
So, people don't really have, again, a good way to conceptualize how massive this risk reduction is.
So, what I'm trying to compare it to is, you know, this is more powerful than the most successful
drugs on the market, right, drugs that are making, you know, a billionth stall here, right? So,
here's, here's two drugs you have, you know, drug for COPD. There's this basically one obvious
point of this is, there's just massive health care savings from this potentially, if we can get
IVF and so on out there because just like many other things. Yeah. Usually, what I'm trying to
get people to grok is like medicine is not very good, right? It costs a billion dollars and 10
years to get a drug to market or you, you prefer to be fixed at the genome level rather than
yeah, but even more than that, I mean, it only has a 30 percent relative risk reduction.
That's what we're comparing relative risk reduction to relative risk reduction, right? We'll
talk about absolute risk reduction later. But the point is, is that some of the best drugs on the
market only get a 30 percent relative risk reduction, then you're least to that drug for life,
and there's side effects, right? If you do this for your embryos, there are no side effects,
right? Like you already decided to do IVF, you're picking an embryo. The question is,
is do you want the embryo to be at higher risk or lower risk? And then that risk level is the
same for life. You don't have to like take a continually trait, take a drug every single day,
right? Because the other thing is that when they do these studies, right? Like you don't actually
get the benefit if you're not perfectly adherent to the medication, right? And there's entire
companies that are built around how do you get someone to actually remember to take a drug every day,
right? That's also not trivial, even if you get a drug to work. Pain. So yeah, then if you kind of
look across the other situations, right? Like you might not be in that most constrained situation
where both mom and dad are at high risk, right? If you're in the situation where mom and dad are
average risk, you're getting up to an 80 percent risk reduction, right? If you're in the situation
where one is high and one is low, you're kind of you know, topping at it, maybe 70 percent depending
on, you know, with the power of that predictor is how well understood it is. So yeah, all this to say
that I think this is like a huge area where people can potentially, you know, massively change
the trajectory of their child's life with really kind of a like surprisingly minimal cost for
like how big of a component the genetics is. And kind of this is kind of what I was trying to
you talk about earlier, which is you know, what are the genetic tradeoffs, right? So you can do
you can build these correlation matrices where you look at, you know, which conditions are correlated
to, which other ones and you can see that, you know, psychiatric conditions, you know, kind of
are the most correlated with each other, you know, cardiovascular conditions are correlated with
each other, but you know, schizophrenia is not correlated with height. It's not correlated with type 2 diabetes,
right? So it's not the case that, you know, you're necessarily trading off risk for one thing
for another thing. And you know, people, again, not just work at any entire physical genetic
community has done a ton of work to look into this and to see, you know, what are the potential,
you know, tradeoffs or or or or share our competitors between these conditions.
Yeah, this is kind of the take home point, right, is that having large and at a risk at birth
is likely more powerful than almost anything else that you can do later in life, right? There's no diet,
there's no exercise that's going to mitigate risk for schizophrenia, right? There's nothing
that can, you know, change, you know, the chance that you're trying to ask pediatric cancer if they
have a specific variant that makes it extremely likely for them to have it, right? So, I don't know,
I think it's sort of like this massive benefit that's hiding in plain sight that people are, you know,
instead of embracing their kind of, you know, coming up with these really, yeah, a logical
arguments for why it should be stigmatized. Yep. Basically, the thing is, you go ahead.
Oh, I was like, I think, I think this is the last point, right? So, I sort of like,
people have actually already surveyed the public and said, you know, what is their opinion
about embryo screening for, you know, childhood onset, adult onset,
polygenic monogenic, and the American public is really strongly in favor of this, right? 72%
either strongly approved or approved of embryo screening. And here's the number that I think is actually
even more surprising, right? So, 30% of Americans would either definitely consider or-
That's a random sample. Yeah. Yeah. It's okay. This is a random sample, and it's also older
folks. So, I actually think that if you let, I think the average age was, I think, like 40 or 45,
which I think is older than fastening or vertical. You know, the set of folks who are actually
going to be considering having kids. If anything, I think this is an underestimate of how many
people would consider, you know, doing IVF. And I think this is actually a 224 paper. Yeah, yeah.
So, I think that, um, I think people should be really shocked by this number, right? The fact that
a third of Americans are considering, hey, I would not have babies the old fashioned way. I would
rather have babies consider using IVF in order to mitigate risk for these conditions that I've been
affected by. I think that that's extremely- Huh? Interesting. Now, I actually represent a sample.
Yeah. At least for, you know, just saying. Yeah. So, I think that this idea that, you know,
IVF is somehow, like, IVF is very different if you are, you know, fertile and you're not struggling
with infertility, right? It's sort of like, hey, it's like this inconvenience that you have to be on
medication for two days. And, you know, it's like a, I mean, for a lot of people, it's like a bad
period, right? I'm not trying to diminish, you know, what it's like to fight infertility. It is
extremely difficult. You know, if you, you know, have PCOS, endometriosis, a lot of these other
conditions infertility is like equivalent to a cancer diagnosis, but for fertile people, you know,
it's an extra, you know, two to three weeks of discomfort compared to, hey, you're going to have a nine
month pregnancy. You're going to raise this child for life. You know, do you really want to
risk, you know, a condition that you've been affected by or kind of these random genetic
typos affecting a child. And I think that a lot of parents are going to say, no, right? I mean,
even just if you think about miscarriage, right? I mean, it's extremely, um, yeah, it's, it's extremely,
you know, emotionally costly suit. Oh, they're here. I can, yeah, I can share the screen for a second
myself. So here is the article that you're just mentioning is pulling it up while you're talking. Here is the
um, approval interest in polygynic embryo screening by this is 2024 article. And so,
actually, this is a great figure, 45% approved, 30% strongly approved, should be allowed 80%.
This is an amazing plastic, just for this, just for this, just for the Twitter bubble, just for
just for people to know, just FYI, it's like 80% should be allowed. Okay, number one. Then
it's either, yeah, right? The idea that, like, there's like, yeah, either for the purpose of PSU's
exactly. Yeah. And then approval for various outcomes. So, you know, for health conditions,
it's like overwhelmingly there, right? But even for, and psychiatric conditions like mental illness,
overwhelmingly there. But even here, it's like close to 50, 50, right? Like, you know,
these are, these are looking like, you know, in the sense of, uh, no opinion. If you delete no opinion
in a sense, right? These are close, you know? So it's like, maybe it's 5 to 1 ratio or something
either what's I like, 80 to 10, 8 to 1 ratio for some of these bars. And here, it's like a 1 to 1,
right, in a sense of close to 50, 50. But, um, that's actually, that's, that's what I've called,
this is non controversial. Yeah. And this is controversial, but in the sense of 50%
support and fiction opposition, which means on the other 50% of states or jurisdictions may actually
legalize it, right? Yeah. So, and then, you know, if you look at what conditions and traits and so
one, so cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's Diabetes, just basically overwhelming like this,
you know, and you get to obesity, and that's actually still pretty high over here. And it's only
only when you get to skin color that's like extremely negative. Even like intelligence, so again,
this is, um, this is close, right? It's, it's more disapproved than approved, but it's not
worse than magnitude. You add up the red and the yellow versus the blue and the other blue over here,
neuroticism and so on. So, BMI is basically very similar to obesity, so it's interesting
that it's different, the phrasing of the question sometimes matters. Um, and then, you know, concerns,
interesting, interesting paper. Good, yeah. So, so I think it's just, people don't, you're, you're
totally right. There's like a Twitter bubble, and people don't realize that, you know, the vast majority
of people, I, 80% of people support embryo screening in a toy 24 setty. Yeah. Yeah.
It's just important. Actually, Sammy, you're deck also because I will preview this, uh,
I will preview this pod with the, um, with both that and the one-based pair, right? Like
is a foot three versus two foot seven, you know, literally one delta alteration.
This is really one. Because just, I want to give you just one asterisk on that one. So, um,
I don't have those people's genomes. I just looked up for gigantic antism and a thunder
pleasure. Okay. No, no, no. So, yeah. So, we're not giving them a diagnosis. I'm just saying,
for gigantic antism and a thunder pleasure, this is, these are the single-based pair calls of them.
So, just, I'll give you, like, exact copy if you want, like, how, what those mean, but I just want
to give the caveat. It's like, we're not giving them a diagnosis. We're saying four people who have
gigantic antism, right, caught a pleasure. So, I think, I want your commentary on, like, the moral
necessity of this, and then maybe a little bit of your commentary on the scientific side too.
Because I think I might have gone too deep, so I'd rather, I would like for you the, like,
summarize it, but, well, first is, um, I mean, on the left, the entire thing for the last 50
years has been my body, my choice. So, how could that possibly not extend? How could you, how could
you define reproductive choice? So, narrowly, as to say, it only extends, like, you can only
turn me in some cases or not others or screen, and so that doesn't make any sense at all, right?
So, just, just, just choice alone. So, basically, everybody who's in favor of reproductive
choice on the left should obviously be in favor of embryo screening, or certainly not pushing
to ban it, even if they don't do it themselves. If, you know, as they say, if you don't want
to don't have one, right? As for the right, I do understand the social conservative argument.
I disagree with it, because I think that the quote, wisdom of repudence could be applied to many,
many, many, many, many, many things, right? And what we think of as normal, like,
circumcision could be considered really bizarre, and, and is considered bizarre, and it's
some historical cultures, or would have you. Heart transplants would be considered bizarre in some
cultures, um, certainly past culture surgeries, um, like screening of blood, you know,
urine samples, fecal samples, all the stuff that's like completely normal in any biomedical clinic,
if you just go by, oh, that grosses me out, you wouldn't do it. And we have millions of IVF babies,
and we have millions of IVF procedures, and we have existing screening for antibodies and
monogenic disorders. We have all the infrastructure set up. We have 80% support from people as your
paper shows for screening, even in the West, and it's almost certainly higher in the East,
just given given the numbers I've seen. And the whole point of the human genome project,
billions and billions and billions of dollars was to use the genome for human health,
like all these taxpayer dollars went into this. So that's yet another argument that is,
if you were a taxpayer on this, it's your right to use that information, right?
And then you're also choosing your partner, that's 50%, and that certainly wasn't a roll of the dice,
and this is like an edit around that. Then we're over for many populations like South Asians.
Chronic disease is actually, unfortunately, the average outcome, because in the modern
environment, modern nutritional environment, we have very high rates of, um, of heart disease
and of type 2 diabetes and other kinds of conditions. And see, put all that together,
and it is really something where people are some people are just reacting in this really stupid,
emotional way. And you know what, that's their right for themselves, you know, for themselves,
whatever, you know, I'm not certainly not saying they should do it if they don't want to do it,
but they definitely can't stop somebody else, because at some place, you know, some point on
the face of the earth, there will be given, given that it's controversial not in a 99 one way,
but at most a 50, 50 way, there will be 50% of jurisdictions that do it. And then what are you going
to do? You can reverse the argument on them. You're going to discriminate against that IVF baby.
Oh, huh? You know what, you think they shouldn't exist, right? And, um, so in general, I think,
uh, one of the most interesting things about this, by the way, is a dog that didn't bark.
Which is that tech isn't favorite of this, right? And, uh, that is a huge thing where the
builders aren't favorite of this, because we know life is hard enough. Life is, uh, there's a lot
of difficulties in life. Um, and, uh, you know, if somebody has chronic disease, heart disease,
or something at 50, and they could have not had it, why would you, you know, it's this weird
thing where life expectancy, by the way, as you know, was quite low in the 800's average life
expectancy, because all kinds of infant mortality had not been solved, right? So, if mortality
is very high in the past. And, um, as a consequence, you know, people used to write, and even adult
mortality was high depending on how far back you go, right? And, I mean, people within are,
I mean, I mean, great-grandparents' generation, um, all kinds of modern conveniences from electricity,
running water, all kinds of things were just not present. And so, you know, really,
what it's related to, I think, the resistance, not, I mean, the resistance, the embryo screening
is part and part, I think, of a broader anti-tech thing within the West, which is like people
setting self-driving cars on fire, right? People getting mad about AI, people getting mad about
crypto, people getting mad about immigrants taking their jobs, people getting mad about, you know,
data centers, and their electricity consumption, or something like this. People just getting mad
about tech at all, because tech is changing a lot of things, and they just want, you know, no more
stop, you know, I want to just, I just want to stop when a reverse the world and so on.
This is similar emotion in the late 1800s, early 1900s, uh, around the industrial revolution.
And, uh, you know, because the big, belching factories, all the pollution and so on,
and to be clear, I'm not saying that there aren't some, you know, like, we develop cars,
and then we develop walkable societies, and we took away highways from some parts and so and so
and so we developed a thing, and we realized we had overdeveloped it somewhat, so we removed some
developments, but we kept developing cars who still did electric cars and self-driving cars
and now flying cars, but also had walkable communities and so there's a balance between them.
And, um, you know, my view is life is difficult enough. Why rule the dice?
Doesn't, why rule the dice when you would have to. There's going to be five thousand more
dice rules. Yeah, you would do this by a car. Why do you want to also have to go blunt?
Yeah, you can, you can't, you already get hit by lightning, you get by a car, you can, um,
I mean, there's this five million other things that can go wrong, right? Why, you want to, you know,
again, this is, this is the kind of person I think who, maybe they don't want to put on their
seatbelt, but why they print you from putting on a seatbelt, you know? Yeah, so what do you think
is this dealman? Like, what do you think is the most, like, I think we talk a lot about the
arguments that kind of are just non-sensical, they just result from ignorance of not understanding how
the genome works, how IVF works, how um, you know, genetic screening works, right? So what do you
think are maybe even the most, um, oh, since your dealman, your arguments? Yeah, I'll show the
dealman would be that far left is have abused science to call it capital S science and they said
masks don't work before they do and they said that the during the BLM riots that racism is a real
pandemic after telling everybody to stay inside and they people ran outside and they call a paper
those published a day ago in nature, they call that science capital S sciences if it has the same
number of replications as Maxwell's equations, because they equate prestigious citation
with, and they basically substitute prestigious citation for independent replication, independent
replication of what science is. Yeah, go ahead. Oh yeah, I just would say yeah, like yeah, and by the
two totally more than, yeah, the replication matters way more than, uh, I guess, we're just a journalist,
yeah, exactly. And so the thing is that the peer review basically means like two or three thumbs-ups.
It's like if you imagine actually you need to be a social network where people post papers
two or three likes from someone in that social network, it's a peer review paper. It's
not like they're, it's rare that someone goes and replicates the result. Where the replicate the result
is on GitHub where you get clone and then you try to compile it or build it, right? So that's actually
where you get replications and that's actually the future of what academia is. It looks a lot more like
GitHub and reproducible research and so and so forth. Yeah. But so, so because of that, there's
enough course universities are like 90% Democrat or something like that. And a lot of people
have not gotten a share of all the technological progress. And of course, we're also demographically
different from a lot of people. You know, we are, uh, so tech is in the U.S., it's focused on the
West Coast, it's focused in cities. It's got a lot of immigrants, got a lot of Indians, box signings,
Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Gaze, Jews. Um, that's, that's how, you know, the right we can
sort of foreign. And then for the left, it has too many white men capitalists and, you know,
so on and so forth, right? And, um, and so both the far left and the far right, look at it as alien
and different and the far left emphasizes the capitalism and the right emphasizes the immigrants
and the left doesn't like the economic change and the right doesn't like the cultural change.
And they basically just wanted to go back to the bay was very roughly, right? And that is just an
whole line. Oh, go ahead. That is quote by us, is what you're saying.
More than San Francisco bias, unibomer bias, right? What I, what I actually think is going to happen
just to digress for a second is not even digress. Many years, you know, I mean, five years ago,
Ish, I realized and I wrote about this at the time that after all the German drawing,
that after everything is said and done, the final political access will be, let's call it,
futurism versus primitivism, right? They will call it humanism versus transhumanism.
Because they'll say, oh my god, transhumanism is a salababa. So, and we're just being human,
we're being normal, right? Yeah, the thing is being a normal human means no electricity, no
running water, no light bulbs and so it's over in their heads, okay? And so like there's no way
that societies, cities could have the carrying capacity to have a unibomer lifestyle where
is literally living in the woods. But we do have that as part of our DNA in a literal sense,
because we, you know, our common ancestors were similar to chimps. And so we do have millennia of,
you know, the outdoors and so on in our DNA in a sense. So there's some, you know, genetic
yearning for that, I'm sure. However, there's another interpretation which is that humanity
is actually defined by technology. For example, Richard Rangam is a book which is like cooking
me at his human. Why? Because the fire allowed us to externalize metabolism so you could spend
less energy on your gut and put more to the brain. And then if you, you take fire, you take weapons,
like the spear, you take clothes, right? The spear, you don't need fangs, with the clothes,
you don't need fur, with a fire, you don't need gut enzymes. And all three of them freed up more
calories for the brain. And so in sephalization quotient just rose across
hominids and, you know, I posted that a while ago, it's like the first singular, do you see that?
The original singularity. Oh, this is a good one. Yeah, it's basically, it's like, it's basically
took, you know, millions of years for, you know, the human brain to evolve. So it's sort of like
if you compare that to, you know, GPUs and CPUs, it's like the timescales are very different.
Yeah, by all two. And by the, you'll want to increase true, right? Yeah. But this is the original
singularity, right? And the thing about this is what that means is since humans begin, we have
been pushing it into software. So the same process that took all of the, you know, it took fangs,
it's really meant to spears and took fur and turned into clothes and the took, the gut enzymes
turned into fire and pushed everything into the brain to manipulate all these tools.
It's the same thing that's taken all kinds of devices from a camera to a recorder and so on and
push them into software in the phone. The same kind of thing that's taken all kinds of tools and
just pushes them into AI, right? That takes all kinds of stuff and pushes into the screen and
into software and you have less hardware and it's more done in software, right? So we have been doing
this concept of pushing everything into general purpose software has actually been a winning
strategy for 10 million years, right? And this also says actually what makes a human is the use of
technology. Yeah, because in Abe can't use a spear, it can jump, you know, along the woods or
whatever, right? But you know, I mean, they can use some basic tools, you just finish at my point.
They can't, they can't, uh, uh, uh, uh, animals, unlike humans, basically can't use technology.
It's really not advanced technology. So actually technology is what makes a human and reversing
technological progress, you know, stopping to let alone reversing it, it actually makes us unhuman.
It's anti-human, right? So that's why I called them primitiveists because they want to
regress to something in the name of doing something natural to doing something unnatural and they're
stopping the singularity that actually defines humanity, right? Yeah. So that's actually the crucial
reversal because it's actually, you know, the primitiveism is essentially the new version of communism,
because communism also appealed to kind of the natural, small group sharing and so and so forth.
Primitivism has enough changes to its genetic code that conservatives don't recognize it as communism,
even though it's the same thing. If communism was against capitalism, primitiveism is against
technology, okay? But of course, technicapilism is a very correlated thing, right? So we have
antibodies to communism because that then that's against capitalism. So instead of targeting
capitalism directly, they'll target technology, the left will be against the capitalist and the right
will be against the immigrants and the center, a lot of well-meaning Jonathan hate type guys
will be against the phones. The problem is, I understand why they're against the phones,
but basically moderated use of phones works in many other cultures around the world. The problem
with the West is they don't have any moderation of use of phones for kids and so forth, right?
So what happens is you have a collision of values that just don't have any sense to them.
Well, what do you think is, how this is going to play out for reproductive technologies?
Like, do you feel like it's going to fall on these similar lines of primitives versus?
Absolutely. Primitives for sutures will be the axis and it's going to be legal in some
important jurisdictions, probably certainly in tech forward jurisdictions around the world. The
same kinds of places probably that are pro-crypto and have digital nomad visas will probably
have legal embryo screening and so and so forth. In the same kinds of places that are falling to
primitiveism of the blue or now the red varieties will probably be against them. Or we don't know.
It's unpredictable. It can be very, the future is fragmented and you will have a lot of different
combinations of ideologies that make sense to those individual people versus just a clean
left and right. And so at least some of those tribes, some of those jurisdictions,
will be in favor of technology and those will probably be some of the best places to be. Usually
they'll probably be the places that are prosperous enough that they're not just prosperous enough,
ascending. ascending jurisdictions are also ascending at the same time the
internet is ascending. So they have a positive association with the advanced technology.
The West, minus tech, is descending while tech is ascending. So even if they're rich, they're descending
world and whereas for let's say India or you know the Philippines, even if it's poor, it's ascending
world, right? So that's why like developed and developing world is the wrong way of talking about
because that implies a static, developed world and the developing world is moving towards it.
Instead, it's the descending world and the ascending world. Yeah, I know. Yeah, that's a great point.
Yeah, so I guess too many roles will be pro all of this. Yeah, so do you want to kind of like just
summarize what you feel like sort of the like the moral cases sort of like what do you think?
Like how do you think people are going to see this like today and maybe like how do you think
that's going to that's going to change over the next couple of years as it becomes more popular?
It's a reduciting known moral principles in the West for life. It's just reproductive choice.
Yeah, your point blank. For the right, it is small government and why interfere with,
you know, somebody's personal decisions. That's like that's a very short secular political case for it,
right? Then you can go and you can quote, you make the religious case in terms of doctrine and
scriptures and so on and so on and so on. I don't think many, you know, it may turn out that there's
some people who can quote Christianity and so on and get this. I could certainly quote Hinduism for it.
I'm sure I could probably find someone who quote Islam for it because there's many people in
Middle East who are very pro embryoscreen, many people in the Jewish community who are pro embryoscreen
because of care and testing. So you could probably find scriptural arguments. I'm sure I usually
four against something, but in general I think the major faith groups could be for it.
Yeah, I think that would be my concise moral argument for it. And then, you know, the
thing, one of the issues is some of the arguments put forward against this are just based on
genuinely stupid reflexive, like an AI, you know, like association day like this, right?
Yeah. And they just get mad for the sick of getting mad, you know? And they associate like a
grain of sand embryo as the same as a human, as the same as this as the same as that. And these
rhetorical equations simply don't map the reality. And this like always isn't nice to have some
chance to pit her pattern of poems. And I think there's a great tweet that you had just like,
this is like a guy talking about how great it was to pick berries that didn't like the rise
of agriculture, you know? It's just, the thing is that kind of argument is to them, very convincing,
because it just feels, you know? But feels can't build. Feels can at best for them, ban.
But feels like doesn't know an A from a C from a T from a G, usually, right? So they can try to
ban in those jurisdictions. And then they just won't be able to do it globally because you can
show the poll numbers and so and so forth. So so long as the feels,
yeah, I think the trend is, you mean you're great argument right around that, right? Because
it's sort of like, hey, we traded electricity for candles, right? We traded cars for horses,
right? We traded, you know, Oregon transplants for death, right? We traded epidurals for
having, you know, a pregnancy. But the soldiers for guns were considered really cowardly,
relative to like soldiers with, you know, knights with swords who'd actually go up and see you
and chop you and sort of like, you know, today we think of a soldier with a gun as brave.
But in the past, they were thought of as cowardly because they wouldn't just go up to you and hit
you with a sword, right? So moral intuitions do change over time based on the baseline of what
people think is, you know, the right thing to do, right? Yeah, exactly. I think basically pointing
out like, hey, what is lost, you know, from, you know, having, you know, babies through sex is like,
it's basically kind of like the most standard cliche for anti-progress, right? It's like if you
only look at what's lost and you don't look at what's gained, I mean, you could make that argument
for, you know, why don't we, you know, hunt our our own food with a bone arrow and the
British, British door, it's like something lost for, but what is gained, right? Like,
the macro argument, I'd actually say is not even really the moral argument, it's a correlational
argument. If people feel that their fortunes are just in general declining, which they do in the
West, outside tech, they'll just be against any kind of change whatsoever, especially from the tech
guys. If you're in tech and change is generally being good for you, you'll generally be neutral or
positive on change. And if you're in the east or more generally the ascending world, then you're
also going to be more positive on tech. So we should look to tech and the ascending world to legalize
this stuff and we should not look to the descending world to support it. And we should need to
divide jurisdictions on that basis. And then you just kind of, you know, like I'm not saying
everybody in the ascending world will support it and everybody in the descending world will oppose it.
But that's the way that you, you should expect things to play out, right? That's actually the
macro above even the moral intuition. Yeah. So what do you think is, is so threatening to people
about it? Like, why is it? Like, I'm genuinely surprised by the amount of activation,
I don't know. I'm just kind of curious if you feel like you have any other thing. I mean,
you know, well, first is people have been inculcated to literally don't understand what genes are.
Like, they got mad at the Sydney Sweeney has great genes at, right? Huge numbers of people
got mad at this. It's just a pun because they're like, I can't believe you're saying genes could
do something. Oh my god, right? So like, it's, you know, in many ways, American society is like
twisted into knots over genetics, over all kinds of things. You know, it's this bizarre kind of thing where
they're, I mean, look, there's a lot of wars or kill a lot of people. And they're much less,
you know, I don't know. I feel that the concern is, one of the things about it is,
the concern is like, it seems like extremely angry on the day that it hits, and then they just
move on to the next thing two or three days later, right? It is just very much a passing storm.
And if you just keep building, they just don't have the attention span or anything like that.
Yeah, I mean, I think that's, that's the thing that I think is most, I don't know, I guess
makes me feel the best about it actually. It's like basically the benefit to each individual parent
is so great that like random, you know, negativity is not enough to convince them, right? It's sort of
like, for each individual parent, it's the difference between is there child, you know, it can
be able to meet their development until milestones, be able to walk, be able to talk or not.
And then for these other people who are kind of, you know, being negative, it's like,
you know, they don't really have anything at stake, right? So it does feel like it's like really
unique part of, you know, health care decisions where people actually get to, you know, vote with
their feet, and then decide, hey, like, this is a thing that's going to make a difference for me and
for my family, and you know, they'll be willing to do that even if, you know, there's a lot of,
you know, loud voices on the other side. Yes, ma'am. I agree. Okay, cool. All right, so when we wrap
there, and any last words, any other things you want the audience to come away with?
No, no, I think it's great. I'll send you the slide, and I'll even send you the slide notes too,
and then you, if you want to like, AI, read your algorithm to whatever content that you want, that'll be great.
