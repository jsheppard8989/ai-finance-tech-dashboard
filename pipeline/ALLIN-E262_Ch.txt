Okay, everyone.
By popular demand, we're doing an all-epstein show today.
My besties are all in vacation for ski weeks, so I'm taking this on solo.
We have three different guests on who all have very different interpretations and opinions
of the Epstein story.
Sagar and Jettie from Breaking Points believes that the Epstein story shows that there is
a quote-unquote Epstein class that operates above law and accountability.
If you use the story as an indictment of our ruling elites, Michael Tracy is skeptical about
many of the most delicious claims about Epstein and questions whether they meet any kind
of evidence-free standard.
He has criticized the media feeding frenzy over what he has called Epstein mythology.
And finally Kevin Bassis, Susan journalist, has been tracking the release files and posting
his findings on X, specifically in regards to Reed Hoffman, perhaps the figure in
tech most closely associated with Jeffrey Epstein.
Some of it gets heated, but hopefully you'll come with new perspectives and great information.
I felt like it was important to showcase a range of viewpoints on this issue.
I'm trying to keep an open mind and I'll describe my own point of view at the end of the show.
And with that, here we go.
Sagar, let me start with you.
What is the import of the arrest of Prince Andrew in the UK this morning?
I mean, is this a case of, show us the man, and we'll tell you the crime.
I mean, it obviously it seems kind of coincidental that he's not being arrested for misconduct
in the Epstein affair.
He's being arrested on mishandling, I guess, trade secrets or public documents.
So obviously the timing, this is not coincidental.
No, it's certainly not coincidental, but I do believe that the facts do matter in this case.
And unfortunately, you know, for Prince Andrew, for Lord Mandelson, the former ambassador
to the United States from the UK as well, it is pretty clear cut that they did violate
their official duties.
We should remember that the crux of this case involving Andrew is not just about some
of the accusations that were made, although that is the genesis.
Let's say of the investigation of the interest.
This is about Prince Andrew serving as a UK trade advisor and forwarding non-public information
to Jeffrey Epstein has been released.
That's currently in the file.
Some of it is involving scheduling.
However, Gordon Brown this morning said that he had actually shared some new information
with Scotland yard in the police.
So none, it's not exactly just what's in the file, but it could potentially be other
material that Gordon Brown and the chancellor were able to investigate as to what Prince
Andrew was sharing as part of a broader probe into Lord Mandelson and the tip off that he
gave to Jeffrey Epstein about an upcoming bailout.
And I do think that this does reveal a quite a lot about Jeffrey Epstein, the next is the
genesis of his rise to power his wealth and his influence.
Having been involved, let's say even some of the co-hosts let's say on this very podcast,
which is a deep financial knowledge of money laundering networks, trying to be at the very
forefront of moving money across the globe, which I believe is his real power and his
influence, which is what enabled much of the behavior that much of the public is now horrified
by.
Okay, I can't let that just go by.
What do you mean by involving co-hosts of this podcast?
Well, I'm talking about Jason, I actually thought that the Jason email was very interesting.
So you'll see that in 2011, the Jeffrey Epstein is contacting Jason about Bitcoin.
This is by, I saw I watched your discussion.
I'm not implicating him in any crime.
I'm saying, if you watch and look at that email very closely, you are watching Jeffrey Epstein,
a master money launder and financial mastermind himself, be at the forefront of the Bitcoin
technology and wondering about it in 2011, which as Jason even pointed out in the last
episode that you guys did about this, when Bitcoin was some one dollar and some sort of
open source project, like to me, that shows how at the forefront he was of new technology
and new ways to move money, sort of, tissueously across the globe, which is what I believe
was his real strength and his basically, his, his, uh, raise on debt for being so useful
to all of these different foreign governments and intelligence assets, including ours,
Russia, Israel, various different Israeli, various different intelligence networks across the globe.
Yeah, let me just for viewers this episode who didn't see that episode, let me just summarize
what exactly happened there, because I want to just make sure that Jason's reputation
is not unfairly impuned, and I don't think you're doing that, but just be absolutely clear
about it.
What happened was that Jason hosted an episode of this weekend, startups, roughly, I think
in 2011 with a couple of the Bitcoin core founders, and then Epstein reached out to him
for an introduction to those people.
I thought, and one of my takeaways from that was, like you said, say, Garret, that Epstein
was extraordinarily early to Bitcoin.
He clearly had a nose for putting himself in the middle of things.
I think 2011 is what I discovered Bitcoin, so that was relatively early.
I thought it was almost comical the way that Jason was trying to warn Epstein, oh, you don't
want to meet these guys.
These are some crazy, they're like these crypto libertarians, they want to take down
the government, there's no profit, there's no investment opportunity here in a way was
kind of comical that Jason was trying to warn Epstein about the Bitcoin guy as rather than
vice versa, but I don't really think people knew at that point in time what Epstein was
involved in.
Do you just agree with that?
Do you think people should have known by 2011?
Well, David, I mean, I will say, there is a way back machine, and we can go back and
we can look at what the Google results were, and we do have somebody who played guilty.
And look, I mean, this is for every individual to make up their own mind.
You can't Google for solicitation of prostitution involving a minor.
I mean, that was literally a matter of public record.
I can only speak for myself.
That's not really somebody I would involve myself with, even at a professional level.
And you know, how do you know?
Well, you can Google it.
It's literally.
But it wasn't widely publicized at the time.
I thought it did post.
There were news of the problem.
I got the Palm Pete Beach story didn't come out until, or sorry, maybe as Miami
Harold didn't come out until 2018.
Well, you're, yeah, you're talking about the 2018, kind of the broader story.
But the original solicitation of prostitution involving a minor charge, 2007, I believe, is
when the non-prossicution agreement came to bear that was all public record in terms
of registration of a sex offender.
And again, you can use the way back machine and you can go back and look.
I mean, again, this doesn't necessarily implicate anybody in a crime and anybody can
make up the decision for themselves as to how they would have, you know, involved
themselves with that person.
But it was, it was out there.
Like it wasn't unknown.
And I do think it's not really responsible to imply otherwise.
Quick factual clarification on that, although it wasn't an enormous story at the time.
You can find coverage in the New York Times in July of 2008 after Epstein pleaded guilty
to the two state-level prostitution charges.
We didn't have the full scope of the information, obviously, about what he was accused of,
or the nature of the non-prossicution agreement, but a Google search would have yielded that
at that time.
That's right.
Yeah.
It's hard for me to judge.
I certainly, in that time period, had never even heard of Jeffrey Epstein.
And I don't think most people had.
And it has become sort of a cause to lab.
I mean, wasn't it more around his 20 last year?
I would say 2018.
2018.
Yeah.
I think it's important to explain.
When he readily operated Miami-Herald series by Julie Cape Brown, which is just right
right with errors and mischaracterizations, became this sensation across the media landscape
and Julie Cape Brown was showered with all these accolades from all these bogus journalism
industry organizations, even though, for example, I caught her fabricating quotes and
her book perversion of the justice, which was based on the initial Miami-Herald series.
So Michael, I don't think that you would deny that ultimately, that this did not, yes,
it was sparked by Julie Cape Brown's Miami-Herald stories, that a federal judge was not
necessarily like, you know, a federal judge who reviewed the non-prossicution agreement
did say that this was a violation of the Crime Victims Rights Act.
Yeah.
That was a return on appeal.
Right.
Well, I understand, however, at this is also gone forth to the Supreme Court involving
the lane Maxwell, as I understand now, was currently being litigated, but I do think
it is.
No, the Supreme Court rejected it.
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
What I'm talking about.
Appeal.
I'm talking about the Maxwell appeal, but specifically the non-prossicution agreement
and the overturning is what re-led to the current indictment of the 2019 indictment of
Jeffrey Epstein.
No, wrong, Sager.
No, go ahead.
I'm happy for you to explain it to me.
Go ahead.
I mean, this is a misconception.
The non-prossicution agreement was never overturned.
The lane Maxwell's argument includes, let me just finish.
Sure.
The lane Maxwell's argument in her appeals included citing the non-prossicution agreement
as something that she claimed she ought to have been covered by, and therefore insulated
from federal prosecution, which was initiated against her in 2020.
The non-prossicution agreement was never nullified.
It was never avoided.
Bradley Edwards, the victim lawyer, attempted to convince federal judges to somehow
nullify it, but he failed.
The reason why Jeffrey Epstein was federally reprusicuted in 2019 is because prosecutors
in the Southern District of New York, more incomi at all, concocted this cockamamey rationale
for how they could circumvent the non-prossicution agreement by claiming they found
a new victim in New York, claiming that there was some interstate nexus in which they could
tie some of the old Florida allegations, but it was never nullified at all.
So just to be clear, I apologize for not being very specific in my language.
It was ruled in 2019 that had violated the Crime Victims Rights Act.
That's what led to the reinitment, but what I'm specific.
Well, no, there was no connection.
Well, no, because that led to the story reopening from Miami-Herald and that led
then to the 2019 SDMI.
You got you, I'm sorry, I'm not to be combated, but you have your chronology wrong.
Well, Miami-Herald's story was based on Jolika Brown, Jolika Brown, Jolika Brown,
colluding with the victim's lawyers, not the court ruling on the crime victims, right?
Exactly.
All right, guys, let me just get control of this again, because I think we're going
down a rabbit hole, and there's lots of aspects of this story that we could discuss.
I think that we should probably judge each person who interact with Epstein or visit
his island, so forth and so on, individually, in terms of what they actually did, what
they actually knew.
The saga, I just think you're being a little bit unfair to Jason, because all he did was
exchange emails with...
I don't know if I was in the 2011 time period, that's all.
What I was trying to point out was Jeffrey Epstein's knowledge or interest of Bitcoin in 2011,
and that links to a broader Epstein involvement with money laundering and tax fraud and
is so called involvement with Leon Black, and many of these other multi-illionaires who
paid him lots of money.
I'm just saying I'm putting that as part of a period of time to a broader ski.
And I think that exchange was not worthy for the reason you just said, which is that Epstein
somehow was putting himself in the middle of all sorts of things.
I mean, he's almost like a zele like figure who pops up in many different newsworthy
stories over the last few decades, which is what I think makes this interesting.
I think maybe a question for each of you is, who do you think this guy ultimately was?
I mean, you hear all sorts of theories, let's say maybe the Epstein maximalist position would
be that he was an intelligence asset or intelligence agent who was running a vast
comprehensive operation on his island, and thereby was corrupting and blackmailing the
world's elite to someone who, I think Michael, you have a different point of view on that.
Let me not characterize it.
I'll let you guys do it.
But Sagar, let me start with you.
Who do you think this guy was?
And ultimately, you know, at a 30,000 foot level, what do you think is going on here?
What does this Epstein story really about?
And then Michael, I want to go to you and see.
Yeah, sure.
I mean, I do think that there is a very low IQ unfortunate, you know, explosion of accusations
that are out there.
And I want to be very responsible in the way that I describe it.
I think the Jeffrey Epstein was somebody who arose under very suspicious conditions in
the 1980s, potentially involving Iran, contra, knowledge, specifically with arms traffickers,
like Adnan Khashoggi and Douglas Lease, Steven Hoffenberg as well, and that these black
market, money laundering, tax evasion strategies were honed over a period, which eventually
inspired various people, like Leslie Wexner and many other multibillionaires.
And that at the very same time, he also had, you know, his sexual proclivities, which I
think at this point were well known, and that those became, and became useful, his money
laundering, specific dirt duties and knowledge and usefulness, let's say, to the CIA
to various other intelligence assets, became a very useful part of the nexus and the post
Cold War environment.
And that at the time, it was also socially known for a lot of Epstein associates that
he had this bizarre practice of often, you know, seeking out massages, which in some cases,
they are saying involving underage girls.
And so to say that he was running a vast, compromot operation, I think, describes too much
intention to what's really happening here.
And the reason why I'm being intentional in my language is that what he clearly was doing
was recruiting and running this like vast massage scheme, also involving the lane Maxwell
at all across the world, Russian and Eastern European women, but also that this behavior
was tolerated in some cases seen by a vast number of the global elite.
Now, the 2007 circumstances of the non-pricution agreement, you know, in Michael and I could
go back on this forward a long time as to the circumstances of which that arose, however,
I don't think Michael, you would even deny that his access to wealth power and money
did eventually allow him to get off with the 2007 non-pricution agreement.
And then the eventual sweetheart deal that he gets with his hiring.
I wouldn't agree with that.
Well, I mean, I don't think the average joke in just higher can star and private investigators
and lawyers to tell some of them.
Oh, sure.
I mean, his assets wealth levels him to secure very high power legal representation.
I wouldn't have to explain it.
But that's what I'm claiming.
But the whole concept of a sweetheart deal to total conor that, okay, well, I'm all right.
Do you like him around?
Michael, I don't want to get off on that.
But just go back to my original question of, what is your 30,000 foot take on what this story
is about?
Who was this guy in your review?
I will answer that.
However, I do want to just stipulate up front that I think this reflex to have to offer
some kind of totalistic assessment of who Jeffrey Epstein was, his very essence, has
fed into so much of the constant churn of algorithmic slot that has generated this hysterical
frenzy around this issue and has led to people being totally deluded about what we're
even talking about.
What you most people, I have some surmises about Jeffrey Epstein.
He definitely was a money manager who, as you mentioned, was sort of like this, zealate
character who didn't have an extraordinary cross-section of connections with people from
across fields and, you know, I just was looking through some of these records in the
new Epstein files, productions and I was looking for something else, but there's an archive
of these old message paths that he had at his Palm Beach House and I'm scrolling through
and it turns out Holly Barry left him a couple of messages.
I had no idea that Holly Barry was ever in contact with Jeffrey Epstein.
So you can always find somebody new and novel who apparently had one dealing or another
with him.
But why are we talking about Jeffrey Epstein right now in February of 2026?
Because he is believed to have been the most prolific child sex trafficker in American
or perhaps world history, which is why this issue might now take down the British government.
It's embroiling Norway, a minister in Slovakia, had to resign over it.
There's a new criminal investigation that was just launched in France, et cetera.
That's what people conceive Jeffrey Epstein to have been.
And that whole notion is based on just an onslaught of mythological nonsense that pumped
out daily by these YouTube shows.
I won't mention names, podcasts, et cetera, social media personalities who are driven by
these perverse algorithmic incentives to be totally divorced from the facts foreground
this rampant speculation that ties in the Mossad ties in unnamed other intelligence agencies
with this presumed implication or this presumed reality that of course we know for sure that
Jeffrey Epstein was running this pedochrime ring.
And we all to the they presuppose a conclusion that's just been floating out there in the
ethers thanks to all this horrendous media coverage.
I think this is the worst story of my adult lifetime in terms of the media coverage and it
implicates the alternative media, the mainstream media and everybody in between.
It's actually shocking.
I will predict here and now that if we revisit this issue and I don't know two or three years,
people will come to realize if I have anything to do with it, that they were bamboozled
on a mass scale.
There's genuine fraud that has been rampant in the journalistic malfeasance.
We're not supposed to ever consider the massive financial incentives where the Epstein industry
is now something like I've estimated a billion dollars in terms of the payouts that have been
given to purported victims who are allowed to just reimagine things that happened to them
20 years before as an adult, not as a child, but adult at the time of their claim victimization
and then called themselves a sex trafficking victim and then they can secure a couple of million
dollars tax free from JP Morgan and the media will hail them as these brave survivors without
doing a single thing to check the veracity of any of their claims.
You know why people are upset?
So upset about these reductions in the Epstein files and I'm upset too.
I criticize Thomas Massey and Rokana for the language of their bill that they craft through
the Epstein files transparency act, which they crafted in concert with Bradley Edwards,
this extortionist quote unquote victims lawyer who's made a killing on this issue over the past
in conjunction with David Boyz, another chryster and Bradley Edwards, his urging,
Rokana and Thomas Massey put in this giant carve out to so-called transparency and disclosure
into their bill such that the DOJ was authorized to redact or withhold or conceal any
information that could be the most tangentially tied to anything that's quote victim identifying.
So they've been arguing frantically in federal court for the past few months that they're opposed
to the disclosure of Epstein files because it's going to terrorize all these beleaguered women.
I don't know. Do you think that maybe if we did get full transparency, it might disrupt
this sanitized quote survivor narrative that everybody pushes so credulously?
I'll just give you one example. I don't want to go on for too long and there's so many threads that
I could pull here that you have to sort of kind of rain the end. But one narrative that could
disrupt if we actually did get genuine disclosure which were not and in fact Edwards at all demanded
that the entire archive be taken down because this disclosure was just too horrendously threatening
to them. We would maybe get more insight into some of the government propaganda that's been
allowed to promulgate unchecked and Sagar, I wonder if you've corrected this on breaking points,
you can let me know. But for months, if politicians across the media, the political spectrum,
as well as the media, writ large, have unthinkingly regurgitated this figure that there were over
1,000 victims of Jeffrey Epstein. Sometimes that gets upgraded to thousands of victims. That's
what Primalajaya Paul said at the Bondi hearing last week, Rokana constantly blurt out this whole
this claim of over 1,000 survivors. And this is based on the July 6, 2025 FBI DOJ memo,
which claimed that they after a review of the evidence after the second Trump administration came in,
they found that over 1,000 victims were called harm by Epstein. So they used this very
conspicuous weasel wordage and it was very dubious to me the instant I read it. Turns out,
you know, thank God on some level for the Epstein files because there is a major revelation
contained therein, which is that this whole, this number is a fraud. It's bogus. They admit in FBI
Memoranda that this number is based on a total of purported victims, the majority of whom
were would have been adults at the time of their claim victimization anyway. But it that includes
the family members of alleged victims in that total number that's been in the body of the victims,
are there? Well, who knows? Why is the government deceiving the public about it?
If people want to imagine your data, I am not sure they don't know.
Let's talk about Pam Bonnie for putting out that phony propagandistic figure and then have it
the repeated ad nauseam without the slightest bit of critical discernment. Well, I do, Michael,
I think we get at least to agree that cash, Patel, and Pam Bondy haven't handled this all that
response on that particular issue. Well, I mean, you're asking me to correct the record of something
I've never even uttered. I've never said the one that I've ever claimed. I mean, I do think
Michael that what you like to do is to go after. And really, I think fundamentally,
I don't know if you even sure if you would reject this, you reject the idea of victimization
that post-victimization can't even happen. And I also, I don't even necessarily want to
get to you. I don't even know what that means. Well, you reject the idea that it's all
uttered. It could be victimized. Let's say by Jeffrey Epstein manipulated, yes,
in even if some cases money works changing hands. I will say, by the way, that just paying or
flying in adult women from Eastern Europe for the express purposes of having sex is a crime,
by the way, sure it's not under age. However, we do have the 2007 draft indictment where there
were a number of underage victims that were mentioned there were Epstein specifically asked
a 15 year old, if he knows anybody who's younger that he could be able to recruit it. And so
I do think your core contention that at the end of that he wasn't quote pedophile is definitely
illegitimate, but I also don't necessarily want to get dragged into the victim stuff, which I think
that you are fundamentally focused on because I do think when you're saying why are people talking
about this, it confirms a general suspicion of the way that people act with impunity
at the highest levels of American or global society in terms of their moral character,
in terms of their dealings, let's say, financially. And you know, you like to brush across
this intelligence question. I actually would love for you to be able to just grapple with some
of the facts. You know, necessarily just related today where these really government was installing
surveillance equipment in Epstein owned apartments by use for the former prime minister of
Israel, a Iraq where we have a Iraq and Epstein, a joking questioningly about Mossad, where Epstein
is FOIA in 1999, the CIA, for any mention of himself, for the very dealings that he himself
had with the arms dealing industry in the 1980s, for the fact that he had a false Austrian passport
at the age of 29 years old, Austria being the capital of spies. A long before he ever became,
you know, very filthy rich. And so Michael, I think what you're obfuscating is a general interest
in the story. And often that what you try to do is find the lowest IQ most maximalist, how
people talking about cannibals or anything like that and paint that. That's a big question.
Michael, even if you're really mentioned the cannibalism stuff, I mean, of course,
you're talking to you. Yeah, you paint the rest of us who believe, let's say, in some of a
bigger part of the story. As you believe, as you believe that we can just accept at face value,
that a 21 year old model, who accepted an invitation to visit Jeffrey's island when she was in
the potentially first-year-olds pretenses. Oh, I mean, pretenses, pretenses by Jean Loup Bernad.
And you know, by the way, it looks too late. No, I have nothing to do with it.
I don't know. This is nonsense. I mean, I can't leave you looked into what I'm about to describe.
Can I have 30 seconds to describe it? All right. Go ahead. Lisa Phillips, who was one of the
women, Sir Quote survivors who spoke at these press conferences in front of the US capital,
and infamously declared that she and her fellow survivors were going to create their own list
of Epstein clients, and then handed over to Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massey, so they could
read it out on the floor of the House of Representatives, under the protections of the speech and
debate clause, and caused a giant media firestorm, as I don't have to remind you, her whole
tale of victimization is that at age 21, as a professional model, she was on a photo shoot in the
British version islands, another girl, you know, or young woman, that she was with invited her to take
a ferry to Jeffrey Epstein's island in the US version islands. She accepted, she never claimed victimization
for like 17 or 20 years. She's on a podcast in 2020 saying, gee, whiz, I never heard anything
all that all this crazy Epstein stuff, but I knew him, and I don't know what went to happen there,
and all of a sudden, J.P. Morgan opens its floodgates for settlements of $290 million dollars.
You know, I know like we're not supposed to acknowledge human nature about what that can
incentivize on this particular subject. I mean, explain that to me, and she now claims that we're
supposed to just take her to be a survivor. She was the one, one of the women who also stood up and
protested, Pam Bondi last week. So yeah, Sager, if you do take it face value, that that person can be
rightly designated as a victim and fuel and foamant this giant worldwide pedophilia crisis that we're
supposedly in the midst of, then I don't know. I mean, I consider you to have a pretty high IQ,
and that's just not some, like, random social media talking about cannibals. Right.
And I tell me, if you agree, that that's a legitimate case of victimization, and it should be,
Mike, I think he's just on the classic example of selecting some nasty look. I'm not here to
defend every so-called Epstein victim, because by the way, I think that what you do very expertly
is finding people like Lisa Phillips and then part trying to portray all of them of that sort.
Like, would you deny that vast wire transfers were sent to Eastern Europe to fly in women
for the express purposes of sex? Because that is, okay, is that not a crime, Michael? Have you
googled the man act? I mean, for somebody who was actually looked into prostitution? I mean,
this is what I'm talking about. Is that, by the way, also, you have not yet grappled with the
2007 draft indictment. Okay, I mean, look, I have unfortunately, I really remember time.
I'll stand for that. So Sager told us upfront that he only had half an hour. So, okay,
you know, we don't have that much time. Listen, Sager, let me ask you a couple other questions,
and then once Sager leaves Michael, we can get you to say what you want to say. I want to go to the
less Wexner deposition the other day. What did we learn from that specifically about how Epstein
got his start? I do think that there are these questions about, again, who this guy was,
how did he accumulate hundreds of millions of dollars or really at his career? How did he seem to
obtain all these different connections, specifically to the intelligence world? Did any of that
get resolved? And what's your take on that? No, David, it wasn't resolved. Unfortunately, the entire
transcript is not public. What we do know from the House Oversight Committee, at least what's been
released now so far, is Leslie Wexner said he was never questioned ever once by the FBI or the
Department of Justice involving this case. I will say if you look at the track record of Leslie Wexner,
it's incredibly bizarre. He claims that F.C. was a con man who stole his money for decades. In 1991,
we had the power of attorney that was signed over to him. He claims that Epstein was a financial
genius and a wizard. We have the transferring of the town home, which eventually there was some
payment that was reconciled on the back end. But an incredible amount of control that Jeffrey Epson
had over Leslie Wexner's finances over the Wexner Foundation, which he used to funnel money
to aid Barack the former Prime Minister of Israel, support many Zionist causes under the Wexner Foundation,
including the Wexner Fellowship currently at Harvard University. I do think it's important for us to
explore some more of that. There's some very odd dealings with the beginnings of their relationship.
Previous Epstein Associates have testified that in 1992, which is shortly after power of attorney
and all of that was acquired, or the relationship, sorry, between Epson and Wexner began,
is that much of Epstein's lifestyle exploded. Wexner does not even dispute that Epson had vast control
over his finances and even claims that he was stolen from. By Jeffrey Epson, their relationship
is supposed to have ended sometime, I think, in 2007. But he has not yet answered questions
about this relationship in an open public form beyond some statements. And he currently did
issue an opening statement for the record. I personally would like to see the release of that
transcript. I mean, all for transparency here in this particular case. He's an 88-year-old man,
and I do think it's genuinely bizarre. Oh, and not even mentioned the modeling industry, which, you
know, which Wexner himself was involved in, and there's several emails, including Wexner's own
crude drawing in the Epson birthday book involving boobs that he said that's all Epson ever wanted.
So, their their relationship is bizarre. Goes back decades. Wexner maintains, as I said, that he was
conned, and then he was stolen from. I don't really believe much of that story. Michael,
you and I have now read thousands of Epson emails. There's no sophisticated financial instruments
going on. I'll even back to the very beginnings of Jeffrey Epson's claims here about managing
money, almost none of it's passes the smell to David. You're a very high net worth individual.
You can go to gold bin sacks or many other financial houses and get teams of people to manage money
for sophisticated financial instruments, and others not available to the rest of us. It'd be very odd for
you to return. So, finance is to, to Jeffrey Epson. Yeah. So, he began his career, I guess, at bear
assurance. I guess it was a brief stint where he worked. I guess he, one of the curious things about him
is he dropped out of college around the age 20. I guess he was studying math. He then was a teacher at
the Dalton school for like a year. Correct. And then he worked at Bear Stearns for four years.
He met a screenberg through the Dalton school. Greenbirds, I think it was, it was one of his children
was there. And then he went to Bear Stearns. He's fired from Bear Stearns after a couple of years.
And that's when he's dissent into what I call like the darkness, his expertise and money laundering.
I believe that that's when it was honed as reflects in the record and the testimony of the
people who dealt with him there at the time, including the false passport, Iran contra,
arm smuggling, and all of that that I've laid out. So, I'll ask you a quick question.
So, I know you have to go soon. I'm honestly curious if you would agree with the statement from
Thomas Massey. This is from February 16th. He says, quote, we're exposing the extent of Epstein's
global pedophile ring and how it touches our government in our aristocracy. So, do you think it's
a factually valid statement that what we know to have taken place and maybe even is still ongoing
is a, quote, global pedophile ring? Well, I mean, when what you're asking about a global
pedophile ring is, well, sorry. This is Thomas Massey saying that Thomas Massey a global
pedophile ring is a ring of global elites who seemed aware and perhaps participated in the abuse
of underage children. Now, Michael, I will grant you this. And what I received you in the
room statement. Well, no, I will grant you this. What I think you do well is to parse the actual
individual claim of many of the victims and others that are out there. And I actually think you have
a great role in the ecosystem for debunking, especially some of them low-ish IQ content, which is
out there. Like you did with the torture video. So, I do want to appreciate you for doing that.
That was so true. I mean, I don't really appreciate this idea. I only focus on low IQ social media
black. Okay. Michael, I tell you very deeply into the legal minutia of all this saga.
So, I know you have, and I'm seeing just casually called a pedophile. It virtually everywhere in
the media. And among every politician, Michael, and if you're interested in what he was making,
three dozen of Michael, is it? No, he wasn't a pediatrician. He looked at the file because he
would like to pre-epost people. So, you find bizarre that for all the enormous media resources that
have been poured into this story over the past, however many years, by newspapers, magazines,
podcasts, Netflix, specials, you name it. I guess I'm the only one who ever thought to actually
go into the Florida court document and pull up the transcript of the plea hearing in June of 2008,
when he entered his guilty police, his guilty plea in Florida for two state level prostitution charges.
And he's called a convicted pedophile. Adnauseum, it turns out the sole minor victim who was
cited in that plea hearing as the sole minor to whom he procured for prostitution was literally 17
years old. Yes, Michael, I understand that because they picked the oldest person in the indictment
to plead guilty to, and there's a 14, 15 year old, which is named in the 2007 South African
Department, which was released. Michael, you're focusing on a federal document, there's a federal
document, which specifically alleges a 14 and a 15 year old who are abusing, including asking a 15 year old,
if there is the 2007 draft that you ever had. No, you were going to take his dispositive? Well,
I'm not going to, okay, unfortunately, it was never, it was never trusted because of the plea
agreement, which eventually came forward. I mean, I think you're using the same tactic Alan
Durshwitz did in his defense. Unfortunately, I have to do with Durshwitz, or I don't share his
tactical maneuver. Unfortunately, you have to take my child to a doctor's appointment. That's
important. As I flagged to, and in the beginning of this entire thing. And I do want to say
operating a good faith as well, soccer for the most part, unlike a lot of people who have
climbed on to this story, and you're willing to engage on the substance. So, that, again,
is appreciated by me and, you know, whatever you'd like to engage further, I'm always available.
All right, Michael. Thank you, David, for the invitation. Yes, thank you for coming,
Sager, appreciate it. All right. So, Michael, let me kind of reset here. Okay.
I'm not sure you've had a chance to kind of lay out your case for what you called
Epstein mythology. Yeah. So, I want to give you a chance to kind of just lay out your thesis here
that what's happening is actually a type of moral panic, or feeding frenzy, a type of hysteria.
You've compared it to the Salem, which trials. Yeah. There was also the case of the 1980s of the whole
Daker Child Abuse. Say, Tannick Panic. This is the same Tannick Panic. What's called? Where I think
hundreds of people went to jail or were prosecuted for that. No, if it was hundreds, but more than enough
to make it a extreme, miscarriage of justice. So, that's the comparison you've made. So, I guess
I want to let you lay out that case in a clear way, because I'm not sure that you've had a chance
to quite do that yet. Yeah. I mean, I definitely laid out my case on this score in many other
venues and on many other occasions, but I guess not on this particular podcast yet, so I'm happy to
sketch it out. In terms of this, Tannick Panic parallel, that's not one that I would have
necessarily been most inclined to bring up until recently, just because there's now this new
layer of the mythology that's added, been added with the production of these
Epstein quote files where people are reading snippets of emails to signify some kind of
coded messaging around cannibalism or around grotesque child sacrifice. That really wasn't a
hallmark of the Epstein story so much before this enormous tranche of emails were released.
And it relates to the satanic panic frenzy in so far as claims around such things as truly
grotesque child sacrifice, mutilation of infants, bathing toddlers and blood, like all the
most nightmarish scenarios you could possibly dream up were alleged in the 1980s and taken
deadly seriously by the authorities resulting in, as you alluded to, a good number of people actually
being thrown in prison for many years. And it was found to be just a gigantic hoax, but
maybe a more app parallel that also would have been apt even before this latest record production
is that the satanic panic frenzy of the 1980s was ultimately concluded to have originated really
with one woman who was just straightforwardly mentally ill, delusional, needed to essentially
be institutionalized and yet she would make claims about sex-abtrial sex abuse that the authorities
countenance or gave credence to. And there's a similar thing going on with the Epstein mythology.
Now, when I mentioned the Epstein mythology, I'm not talking about the 2007, 2008,
Florida non-prosecution agreement or that whole scenario that saga brought up in peace meal
that's a different element of this whole story. The mythology developed later, mostly around
2014 with the introduction of these new claims by Virginia Robertscoofrey and her lawyers,
Bradley Edwards, Paul Cicell, later David Boys, in which she alleged that she had been child
sex-trafficked around the world and that she knew that Epstein enforced this child's sex-trafficking
operation via blackmail, and also she made specific allegations against three particular individuals,
Ellen Durshowitz, Prince Andrew, John Luke Bernel, and then also she accused a generic category
of other high-profile persons who she didn't specify as also victimizing her like prime ministers.
Politicians and presidents and so forth. So that's the basically the origin of what I would
call the mythology, which is just sort of of a different order or magnitude than the initial
Palm Beach prosecution which was effectively a local cry, but in terms of the mythology,
the parallel to the satanic panic. Virginia Robertscoofrey was a profoundly disturbed,
mentally unwell person who was validated and legitimized and now continues to be celebrated as
some kind of martyr for truth, even though if anybody had used a lick of discernment about
asked of her claims, it would have been found that she could not be treated so credulously. Maybe
she needed some help, but this idea that she would be the basis for this global scandal that's
rocking all these countries, it's just outrageous and there are two others who are fondament,
two other mentally ill women, and I don't say that even to be majority, or derogatory at all,
it's just objectively true if you take a look. Maria Farmer is one of these other
definitely mentally ill persons who for example introduced or was integral introducing this idea
that Epstein had camera set up and all his bedroom and bathrooms and was served dishes as a
recording prominent people, so he could use it for blackmail. And then another one Sarah Ransom
was one of the people who spurred the mythology in large part around the island, so she
came to claim after going through several mental health crises that she had been systematically
raped at the island, even though when she actually had to eventually give death position,
she really described nothing of the sort, she was also an adult when she went to the island
voluntarily, and she described what it was effectively a consensual, you know, minor sexual encounter
Epstein, but she dramatized it radically in the wake, and people don't know. I mean, David
did you? Did you know this or does anybody know that they're in the public know that despite
everybody in their mother, including like Rokan and Thomas Massey at all, declaring that the
Epstein property in the US version islands, the private island, that it's rape island or pedophile island,
that there's never been a credible allegation of rape ever discovered that took place on that island,
like is that well known or am I crazy? No, it's not well known. The reason I knew is because I've
heard you on a couple of podcasts, so I thought it was important to get you on as a counterpoint.
So just with respect to these three women, they did go to the island, is that true?
Sarah Ransom did. Okay. Maria Farmer, no, Maria Farmer is the one who purported
that she was actually the original Epstein accuser, and she was this great hero, Whistleblower,
because she tried to sound the alarm way before all these other females were abused.
She claims that in 1996, after she had been a 25-year-old employee of Epstein's who basically
sat at his front desk in his New York townhouse, that she was invited and accepted to go to the
Ohio compound of Lexington, to be an artist and residents of sorts because she was a painter.
And then she claimed that over the course of her interactions with Epstein and Maxwell,
she ended up filing a first attempted police report, and then went to the FBI, and she never
really specified what it is that she claimed that she reported to the FBI with any clarity,
but she told this tale about how Epstein had supposedly stolen these photographs that she had
produced of for younger sisters who were below the age of 18, so that she could use those
photographs to paint paintings of her younger sisters in the nude. I guess that's a confession
to production of child pornography, but technically speaking, but that's what she claimed,
and then she also added that she had been sexually assaulted or abused or raped by both Epstein
and Maxwell, and somehow over the course of that assault at age 26, she had like a divine
revelation literally and realized that they were both pedophiles. This is how she
recounted it years after the fact, and if you look at the police that FBI intake reporter,
the complaint that was memorialized that has come out in terms of the what was contemporaneously
documented, she mentioned nothing about a sexual assault, she mentioned nothing about any kind of
sex crime at all. She simply claims that these photos of hers were stolen, and there's never
any evidence that those photos were actually stolen. So that's one person, and then she's these three
women, ransom, farmer, Robert Schufre, we're all integral in different dimensions of the
mythology. They were incredibly important, name plaintiffs and critical litigation. They
you know, criminal investigations were launched based on the bases of her, their claims and
various respects, and they're all just profoundly mentally ill, erratic, and wholly unreliable
to the degree that if we're going to have an international pedophilic, mass hysteria narrative
that's at all predicated on their claims, then we've entered into a fantasy land because it will
never in the future hold up to any kind of rational re-evaluation or scrutiny at all.
Okay, so Robert Schufre or VRG is, as I think you've called her in your sub-stack,
yeah, when did she come forward with her, yeah, her story? Because she was the basis of that
Netflix movie or documentary called Filthy Rich about Epstein. You were saying that that happened
after the whole 2008, Palm Beach. Yeah, I'll explain, by the way, Filthy Rich, which over this
past summer, when the Epstein Fierre kind of got reignited, it like skyrocketed, it like the one of the
top of the chart on Netflix once again. So that little piece of commercial, commercial propaganda
has been very determinative in terms of how people have had their perception shaped of this issue.
And it is like literal propaganda, I would argue, in the sense that it was concocted as a PR vehicle
for the quote unquote victims, and especially their lawyers to create a public clamor for
some kind of remedial action to be taken against Epstein's co-conspirators or more
relevantly his estate. It was a maneuver. It was a PR maneuver by a legal team who worked alongside
the producers of that documentary. As I've been so much of the mass market entertainment products
that have been produced around the Epstein affair. It's only taken from that one perspective of the
purportive victims, and that perspective is shaped very carefully by their lawyers to create this
sanitized survivor narrative that is now the predominant one. But in terms of her origins, yes,
she initially filed some civil litigation around, I want to say, 09, 2010, maybe 08,
as a Jane Doe. Maybe 2011, somewhere in that range, as first as a Jane Doe, meaning
she wasn't named in the litigation. And this related to a period of around 2001, 2002,
when she was in the Epstein orbit to some extent. And there's evidence that she was in the Epstein
orbit to some extent. She's not hallucinating everything. I've argued that she's not so much a liar,
I wouldn't say. Like, I've never directly accused her of lying about anything as such. I've called,
I've said that she kind of confabulated an alternate reality. And that's a little bit different
because it doesn't necessarily connote willful deceit. And it's almost even more disturbing,
if you think about it. But what's your basis for that? The big one, I guess, is that in your view
that she recanted her story about Dershwitz or, yeah, she recanted her story not just about Dershwitz.
That's maybe the most well-known instance of her recanting one of her marquee claims. And it
really only came about because Dershwitz was unusually motivated to actually pursue some sort of
resolution through a very protracted litigation process against very high-powered lawyers.
I mean, one of the fallacies here is that these survivors, quote-unquote, such as Virginia,
are taken to be these beleaguered victims, et cetera, who had no power at all in this dynamic.
And yet, I mean, they were represented by some of the most powerful and skillful
lawyers in the country, such as David Boyce, who's like, one of the best known lawyers of all time,
and was hugely well-resourced. And also, you know, Virginia,
who freight became incredibly wealthy, maybe not as wealthy as you David, but, you know,
20 estimates range from like $15, $20, $25 million. It's hard to know because a lot of the
settlement details are secret. So it wasn't just this hapless victim who had nothing no
like to stand on in order to make her claims. But yeah, Dershwitz, she ended up her counting her
allegations and bear in mind. It wasn't just that she, you know, happened to level some accusation
at some point, maybe in like casual banter. It's that she made allegations of her self-having
been victimized by Dershwitz, sexually, on at least six or seven occasions. And she described
each individual instance of that victimization in vivid, graphic, almost grotesque detail,
describing Dershwitz's body parts, sexual proclivities, et cetera. And she did this in
sworn affidavits and under deposition. So could theoretically even be subject to poetry charges,
should a prosecutor ever have been inclined to bring them, which, of course, they wouldn't have been in this
environment. And, but it goes much further. She had to recant claims against a harbour for
professor, Stephen Costlen, who she claims she had intercourse with. She recanted even claims against
John Luke Bernel, who's another sort of actor or a player in this whole story that
leads people to make their postulations about their being this supposedly international sex
trafficking ring, because it was like a modeling mogul, but he ended up getting arrested by
French authorities under pressure from the US in 2019 after Epstein himself was federally
indicted and arrested. And given the vagaries of the French legal system, which I don't fully
comprehend still in relation to the United States, he was in custody or incarcerated for quite
a long time prior to any formal charges being brought, eventually she's called to provide evidence
against Virginia as call from Australia to go to Paris to provide evidence against John Luke Bernel
in 2021 in this format that is nothing that takes place in the US, but it's like where the both
of defense and the prosecution have an ability to question or have colloquies with the accuser.
And she ends up having to retract her claims against him as well. And, you know, the her lawyers
had to admit that this memoir that she produced or many more manuscript that she produced in 2011
in 2012 that she was sort of scheming with this ghost writer who was potentially going to
work with her Sharon Churcher, a journalist at the Daily Mail. She was scheming about how they could
get the biggest possible book deal or even like a movie deal or some kind of entertainment package
deal. And she already had been paid 160,000 plus by the Daily Mail plus serialization revenue for
having done an interview with them and given over the Prince Andrew photo. And then they wanted to
marshal or leverage that momentum publicity wise from the Daily Mail articles in 2011 into a book.
And so Sharon Churcher in this email exchange, you can go read it, it came across, it came out
in litigation, says, hey, yeah, you know what, just like throw out, throw out anybody's name
and you can think of who might have had the most fleeting association with Jeffrey Epstein.
And that'll get us the biggest possible book deal. That'll entice the most publishers and agents.
And as to Dershwitz, yeah, I mean, he's pretty well known and we all think he's a pedo. So
throw him in there, too. I mean, that's what they're saying. And this is your interpretation of what
has supposed to look at what they say. I'm almost quoting for, I'm not exactly quoting who said that.
Who said that? This is what Churcher says to Virginia Roberts, Gufray and she's all on board with it.
How do we know that? Does we have the transcripts of the emails?
Wow, okay. And they came out of the course of discovery in litigation.
And this person was, she was a cabaret trash journalist. Yeah, who was with the journalist who
was author of the book with her or what was, they were intentionally be the co-author of the book.
So they were sort of strategizing as to how they could get a book deal or get a literary agent
to sign on with Virginia and get a lucrative book deal. And then what, what ended up happening?
A draft manuscript was produced. I don't know exactly how involved Churcher was in what published or
not initially. Finally, a version did eventually come out last October.
After Virginia Roberts could phrase, purported death in April of last year. And I
only say purported because the circumstances of it are still bizarre. Look, I mean, I'm
willing to grant that she is infected at this point. But I mean, that's another sort of tangent.
But no, it didn't come out for a long time. A draft was produced. And then the draft manuscript
had to be had to be revealed or handed over over the course of litigation with Dershowitz.
And her lawyers by the by 2017 to 2019 had to admit on her behalf. So David Boyz at all,
that this fiction, that that this memoir manuscript, which had been presented as nonfiction,
which was shopped around to potential book publishers as nonfiction, which had been the basis
for a lot of media coverage around these allegations, as though it were a non-fictional representation
of purported experiences, they finally have to admit that it was a fictionalized account
for purported experiences. So this is, this is VRG's own lawyers and it's like David Boyz.
So they basically said that this manuscript, which had been the basis for her story and
a lot of the mythology. Like Bill Claimed. No evidence that Bill Claim was ever on the island.
He did fly around an Epstein's private jet in 2002 and 2003, but no evidence he ever went to
the island. So Bill Claims was never on the island. And which is false, as far as we go, as far
as we know, as far as all the available evidence is ever suggested. That probably is one of the most
repeated claims and respect to Epstein's. This is Bill Claims was on the island and you're saying
that's just completely untrue. And that came from VRG's manuscript, which ultimately,
they had to admit, was more fiction non-fiction, at least her own narrative. Correct. Correct.
But what's so mind-boggling, is that just relatively recently, after this whole blow-up
around Epstein got ignited last July, the book publishers obviously realized that it was a highly
profitable opportunity for them to produce some version of her manuscript in the form of a new
memoir. Now, she had been working on a new version of it with another ghost writer for some time,
Amy Wallace. But they obviously wanted to peg the publication of it to this renewed Epstein
uproar. So this her quote, the memoir finally gets published in some capacity in October of last year.
It becomes international bestseller. Not just in the United States, but in Britain, Australia, etc.
And I'm still stunned. I mean, maybe I can no longer really be stunned anymore. But it's still
stunning to think back on how credulously the reception to that memoir was. Even though, I mean,
it was basically just Amy Wallace, this ghost writer, repackaging and massaging.
I always catch myself when I use the verb massage now. I shouldn't use that. Repackaging
the initial memoir manuscript. And basically updating it for 2025. And no where do they, no where do they
just do they disclose that it's based on a fictional one's manuscript. So it's just a fraud.
Wait, so they originally did publish a version of the maze. Yes, last year.
And did that book include the accusations against Dershwitz and Bill Clinton,
or had that been removed by that point. To clarify, those allegations of sexual
improprieties against Dershwitz were not in the 2011 manuscript. Those were concocted later
as a basis for Virginia Robertsburg afraid to join this ongoing litigation that her lawyer
Bradley Edwards had initiated around something called the Crime Victims Rights Act
and how the non-pricutary agreement from 2007, 2008 had supposedly violated the non-the Crime Victims
Rights Act. It's a complicated issue. But that was they viewed those claims against Dershwitz
where they viewed in December of 2014. But there are a bunch of other claims already in the
manuscript from 2011, and there's a reference to Dershwitz, but it's just not an accusation of sexual
against conduct. Okay, the three women that you mentioned,
Guffray, ransom farmer, did they have the same lawyers or different lawyers or lawyers working
together? Pretty much the same lawyers. I mean, it's basically the same cabal of lawyers. It's
the same lawyer. Bradley Edwards was the initial lawyer that oversaw primarily, the Florida
the purported victims from the Palm Beach phase from 2002 to 2005. He started representing them.
Around 2008, and then boys came a little bit later around the more grandiose litigation,
but they've worked in conjunction with one another and still are. There's still
doing, as in a class action lawsuit that they initiated last October, Bank of America,
to extract a couple of hundred more million dollars, just like they did from JP Morgan and Deutsch
Bank, and the Epstein estate, and plenty of individualized lawsuits that they've alluded to,
but never clarified the parameters of like they brag. Bradley Edwards does that they got like
20 or 25 settlements that are still secret. He says from specific individuals whom he
acknowledges may not have committed any wrongdoing at all, but just simply don't want to suffer
the PR backlash that we're seeing now on steroids. So it's a hugely lucrative industry and
not only do you tell me David, is this like dimension of this whole story ever mentioned anywhere
in any of the popular media coverage, whether it's on podcasts or on CNN or anywhere?
No. Okay, so even the Deutsch Bank settlement, I don't think I'd have heard of that. What was that?
So when Epstein dies August 10th, 2019, right? The, a feeding frenzy breaks out in terms of litigation
that is brought against his estate. Because at that point, Epstein is obviously no longer available
to contest any claims that are made against him and libel laws cease to apply. People are aware,
obviously, that he was very wealthy. He wasn't like a multi-multimate billionaire as a lot of
people suspected at that time, but according to his disclosure of assets when he was arrested,
his net worth was like 650 million, so still a pretty big estate. And so because of this flood
of lawsuits against the estate, the executives of the estate, Darren Indyck and Richard Conne,
decide to agree to coordinate with the victim's lawyers, Bradley Edwards, David Boyz, at all,
to set up a basically a mediation program that they call the Epstein Victims Compensation Fund,
which is a holistic settlement process that victims or alleged victims could submit claims to.
And then there would be a mediator brought in to evaluate the claims and decide what amount of money to
give up. So there wouldn't have to just be like a flood of individual lawsuits that could
kind of consolidate it. And so they set up a settlement model, basically, for the Epstein estate,
which was expressly non-adversarial, meaning there would be no adversarial scrutinization
of the claims that were made to justify somebody's entitlement to millions of dollars.
People claimants were entitled to as much as $5 million from just this one settlement fund.
And it was tax-free by all this. This is what George Bank.
No, no, this is the Epstein estate. I'm getting to Deutschbank because I'm trying to get into
the Epstein estate. From the Epstein estate, the Epstein estate was first in the chronology of
settlements. And so they set up a settlement model, right? So non-aversarial confidential tax-free
because they claim that it applies under, that it could be categorized under the IRS code as
like compensation for in the injury. So therefore you don't have to pay income taxes on it.
And so that could set up, right? And then who adjudicates that?
The court in the U.S. version islands, because the estate was domiciled in the U.S. version islands,
appointed on the recommendation of both parties, an independent mediator or administrator,
Simone O'Lealtruc, her name is who specialized, she claimed anyway. In this sort of thing,
and she had an extra sensitivity towards sexual assault, victim, she claimed.
I mean, it's kind of a phony. But I want to get sucked into that necessarily tangent. But
yeah, so there's the independent administrator. And that was modeled. They said on
previous consolidated settlement mechanisms, such as like the Jerry Sandusky.
I don't know if you're called the Jerry Sandusky Sandusky Sandusky Sandusky.
And it's a scandal of Penn State where claims were made that the football coach had abused a bunch
of boys. And so the consolidated settlement program was set up to pay out settlement suit claimants.
Okay, so that's the episode of the state. So let's get to the right. So then they take that model that
had been set up for the Epstein estate. And then they start going after bank major multinational banking
institutions that David boys and Bradley Edwards decide to very creatively and cleverly, I have to
say a ledge were complicit in Jeffrey Epstein's like world-spanning social sex trafficking operation.
And therefore reliable. What is the nexus between Doish Bank or Bank of America and Epstein?
Were those the banks that he used? Yeah, Epstein banked at those institutions. So first
JP Morgan from like the late 90s to 2013 roughly. And then Doish Bank for 2013 to 2019.
And the argument is that they should have somehow stopped his activities.
Yeah, they were able to do a KYC or something like that. Yeah, I mean, they first started making a
much more accusatory argument about their direct complicity in facilitating and sex trafficking
operation. But with the judge ultimately agreed to, was to that they were effectively,
or they were reasonably guilty or reasonably to be found liable for essentially negligence,
because Epstein would withdraw cash. And that's supposed to trigger certain monitoring provisions
that it was claimed. JP Morgan and Doish Bank did not satisfactorily do. I mean, it was kind of like
a strict argument, frankly, because of like a popular climate around, oh, anybody who was involved
in this anyway has to pay for all this pedophilic sex trafficking, there wasn't a whole lot
really that the lawyers for those banking institutions could do to take the heat off.
Okay, so they said, right? Okay, so they said all the funds. And that, yeah, and how
did the settlement funds those two? So JP Morgan was ended up totaling around 290 million.
And the lawyers end up convincing the judge who presided over this agreement in New York,
the federal judge's rake off to grant them 30% in legal fees or attorneys fees that they claimed.
And Doish Bank was around 90 million or 80 million, maybe. Okay, so it's just to add those up
out. So the Epstein estate was around, if I'm remembering 121 million, and that's gone up actually
since even more litigations have been filed, separated apart from the class action summit. JP Morgan
290, Doish Bank around 80 or 90. So we're already at like a half a billion dollar industry,
and there's plenty of other lawsuits and settlements that have been spawned from this thing.
And so I just have never understood, or I do understand it. So I should correct myself.
I've always found it perversely amazing that this whole aspect of this story is never mentioned
because it's led to such things as this gross inflation of the total number of victims,
where you have a don't say that there's financial incentives. You're saying there's financial incentives here.
And just the lawyers are these are contingency fee plaintiffs lawyers. They get like 30% or what's
there? I mean, these guys are not paid by the hour, right? They're, they get, well, no, what could
that they, I don't think it's no, it's not a contingency fee set up for this. They got the
judge to approve a 30% earmark of the resulting settlement funds to be given over for attorneys
fees. So it wasn't a contingent based on the client. It was at the judge approved 30% of the
overall settlement. Got it. So the lawyers who sort of organized these settlement pools,
negotiated essentially their cut up front with the judge and you're saying that was about 30%
of all this very, exactly 30%. Okay, okay, got it. But if you have a, if you have a set of criteria
that are so lacks, I mean, the JP Morgan even had even more lacks criteria than the Epstein state,
which basically allowed anybody who ever like came within two football fields to Jeffrey Epstein
to file a claim against them and get a $3 million tax free. But the JP Morgan settlement was even
more lacks. So there are people who are eventually, basically rejected, the few who are rejected
from the Epstein estate fund end up getting a settlement from some of them anyway, the JP Morgan or
Dogebank fund. So that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's,
this woman Lisa Phillips who was like an adult model. Never made any claim about anything to do with
Jeffrey Epstein that was wrongful for like 20 years set on a podcast publicly that she had no idea
what these girls were talking about when they make these allegations against Jeffrey Epstein as of 2020.
She said this by 2020 free. She's getting, you know, she never, I asked her, she didn't disclose
to me her full amount. But you know, probably around two million at least and then she they get
free healthcare from, yeah, another settlement between the US version islands, the government of
the US version islands and the, and JP Morgan that they set aside for just free healthcare
for until 2028 for any alleged Epstein victim. And it's just like, don't people recognize how
that can be incentivized this inflation of the number of total victims were told must exist and
that thus gives rise to this mass hysteria and moral panic about like thousands of victims.
I mean, at this bondy, Pam Bondy here, and it was so contentious last week. If it has
you to share a committee, you had people screaming thousands of victims need, you know, demand
justice. And it's just like a concoction that is not grounded in any, approximation of like
empirical fact. So I always say if people want to be mad at Pam Bondy and hash-potel for something,
be mad at them for signing off on that ridiculous memo from last July where they include that
figure of over a thousand victims that has, has given fuel to the most maximalist
conceptions of Epstein mythology in terms of the victims that were left in their wake. I mean,
soccer always wants to, and I shouldn't maybe say too much. I'm not, and I'm not trying to impute
them at all. But I do get a lot of people on the internet doing a variation with soccer did saying,
hey, let's just talk about the Intel ties. Forget all this, you know, gossip stuff around
interesting. I mean, the Intel ties are interesting, right? Sure. I'm, you know, the whole story
is interesting. It's interesting that Epstein apparently met Michael Jackson in his Palm Beach House
and photos of it came out. It's so interesting that he can be a little bit away from Donald Trump
to Bill Clinton. I agree. It's interesting. We bring up one sort of criticism of you and then
I want to give Kevin a chance to get in here. So look, I think it's very important that we
hold this process to evidentiary standards. Like you're saying, I think that people's motivations
need to be examined, especially like the lawyers who are bringing these cases who are, you know,
reaping hundreds of millions of dollars. So I think you are, and I think even soccer admitted
this, I think are playing extremely important role in this process by bringing some rigor and
accountability to a lot of these claims. And I think that's really important. At the same time,
you're not really offering an explanation of so many aspects that are so interesting about
Epstein. And I'm not saying it's necessarily your duty to do that. But I'm wondering, you know,
do you have a theory of how did he accumulate hundreds of millions of dollars? How did he get so
connected? Some people like my pens have said that it all goes back to Bursterns where he says
that one of his accounts was BCCI, which was this notorious international bank that was involved.
Eventually, was shut down because it was involved in international money laundering and crimes,
things like that. So I think this is Mike Benz's theory. In any event, do you have a theory that
would provide a satisfactory explanation for so many of the threads that we see? Or do you just feel
like it's not really your job to do that? And your job is really more just to poke holes in
what are some of the more outlandish claims of politicians or lawyers?
Well, I'm happy to address any little data point that people want to throw out at me. I mean,
I do that all day every day pretty much. So it's not like I'm trying to avoid anything or be at
all evasive, right? So people asking all the time, okay, how did he make his money? What about
Leslie Wester, et cetera, et cetera? So it's not like I'm unacustomed to addressing any of the stuff.
It's just that I feel like there's a bit of a fallacy or a logical flaw in attempting to say
that it's incumbent on me to proper some kind of ultimate totalizing theory. I have a theory I could
sketch out that maybe explains some of what people would like to know in such, you know,
that people are so titulated by, but I think again, one of the things, one of the reasons
is why the coverage of the story has been so horribly bad is that speculation has replaced
fact, and we have this whole mythology or folklore that's developed, and that people just kind of
ambientantly absorb, and then they end up just believing things that are totally false. So for
example, people just believe, and I'm sure that you've seen this, that Epstein must have referred to
his private plane. It's a little, you to express. Therefore, anybody who's ever on the plane must have
known that this was like a child sex trafficking plane, because why else would it be named the
Lolita Express after the famous book about, you know, Paul, your old girl or whatever, who was a sex
real object? It's just like false. I mean, there's never any evidence for that. It was a nickname that
it was invented, like a plant, it was a cheeky nickname invented by this British tabooid. And so that's just
one example of all this flotsome. Okay, Ben, Ben, to go back to you in terms of a theory of how
specifically Epstein got started, because somehow, I guess it was in the 80s, he went from someone who
is just a trader at Bear Stearns, to very quickly amassing a fortune that, I don't know, seems
like hundreds of millions of dollars. I mean, like you said, he died with about 650 million.
I don't know how big of the fortune was in the 1980s. We know that Wexner sold him the townhouse.
I guess one of the details that came out the other day as Wexner said it was that what he was told
was fair market value and Epstein obtained his plane from Wexner. So, I mean, is that the explanation
that somehow he got his start, because Wexner was extraordinarily generous towards him, like,
I'm just curious, like, what? Not quite. So, I mean, there was a huge New York Times article
that was one of the few helpful contributions to the popular knowledge around Jeffrey Epstein recently
in December, where they go through, I mean, they basically said out to answer the question that
everybody always asks with a wink and a nod as though they think that the asking of the question
is supposed to prove that the answer would be fundamentally sinister, meaning how did Jeffrey Epstein
make his money? Because the idea is that he must have made his money by Dintov, his orchestration
of this pedophilic sex trafficking ring that he enforced by Blackmail, or the direction of the
massade, or something like that. And the New York Times goes into fairly forensic detail about
how he ended up accumulating money over the course of the 1980s. So, people could go read that
if they'd like. I mean, I do think that it's fair to say, and saying this does not mean that you
have to have to condone everything that Jeffrey Epstein ever did over the course of his entire life,
but I do think that he was definitely very high intelligence. I do think that he was
highly proficient in mathematics as a young man, which is why he part of why he became a
math teacher at the Dalton School, a pretty prestigious private school, and then end up getting
recruited to bear a stirrens, and it's end up innovating some novel financial maneuvers that
you're probably much more fluent in than me in terms of scribing, because I'm not a finance guy,
but it was around a time where there was a demand for Wall Street to innovate new tactics for very
high net worth individuals to structure their wealth, to lessen their tax burden, to do all kinds of
other things. And Epstein did so, and then he leaves, so he rose to the ranks of Bares star,
and it's pretty quickly, so around age 24, 25, it was like a partner, or he had some relatively
high-ranking position relative to the rest of the workforce at Bares stars at a young age.
He stopped up his own boutique financial advisory firm that's tailored specifically to very
high net worth individuals, such as ultimately Leslie Wester, who's one of the wealthiest people
in the United States. Yes, they do have a, he was definitely Epstein's most important client.
They, there was the power of attorney that was handed over, which is seen unto itself on the internet
to be either inherently sinister or to show us that, of course, Epstein must have been in some kind of
pedophilic collusion with Wexner, but I mean, it's explicable if you actually want to know
what it was about. And a certain point, people just want to have the ability to keep asking
that question with like a gleam in their eye, as though they're supposed to imply that there is this
pedo sex trafficking is the ultimate answer to everything. But, you know, delay Maxwell,
when she gave her proper interview last summer to the deputy attorney general Todd Blanche
in the very first time amazingly enough, that she was asked by any US government official to simply
describe her experiences with Jeffrey Epstein. Imagine that, despite having been integral, we've
been told all these years in the running of the most prolific child sex trafficking operation,
I guess in the world history, only in July 2025 did any government official ever just ask
you to describe what her relationship with Jeffrey Epstein was all about. And she said that she
observed if Epstein doing a lot of work that was seemed very complicated and intense to her
in terms of his financial business. So, for example, Maxwell says Epstein and basically restructuring
all of the finances for Wexner's business holdings. And, you know, he owned the limited,
he owned Victoria's Secret, other kinds of women's clothing outfits and retail or as yet real estate
developments. And Epstein was basically the money guy for all of it. And for a man who in the early
90s was already worth a couple of billion Wexner, that is, if Epstein is getting like a yearly
cut of the revenues, that could add up over time, right? Then they had a handful of other very
high net worth clients, like Elizabeth Johnson, who was an eras to the Johnson and Johnson
fortune, Leon Black, the head fund manager. So, you don't need that many extremely high net worth
clients, right? If you're their go-to money manager, to eventually build up a pretty nice size
fortune, I would imagine. So, I'm not saying we have a full accounting of like every penny that
he ever accumulated over the course of his life, but we have quite a bit of information. And it
just occurs to me that some, the people who are most loudly ask how did he get his money,
almost don't want to know or read into the information that is currently available.
All right. Well, I mean, it is kind of unusual that a money manager in that position would obtain
that much money so quickly. I'll just say, like, from my experience with the money management
business, they're not generally able to charge that much, but we'll even put a pin in that because
I want to let Kevin basket in here. I've been following your feed quite a bit. You are basically
a startup entrepreneur who had got interested in the Epstein files. I think you used AI to analyze
them. And in particular, you've been looking at Reed Hoffman's story about Epstein and you've put
together in analysis. I think you've called it the Reed Hoffman files. I've been following
your tweets and it's quite interesting. Let's start with how you got into this, what got you
interested, and how you've been doing a research. Yeah. So originally, I just saw that there was kind
of a conflict on social media about Reed Hoffman. I didn't know much about the Epstein files
or about that particular conflict, but I was curious. I built some really sophisticated AI tools
you know, mostly using vectorized SQL databases and some of the MCP stuff with the new agents.
And for some other purposes, and so I wanted to port those over to see if I could resolve some
of these questions. Elon had some very strong opinions about Hoffman's involvement. Epstein and
he's usually at least, if he's not always directly on the bullseye, he's usually at least a few
inches away. So I wanted to go check those out. And then, you know, the they came out and I guess late
January, January 30th, the big ones that the big drop that recently happened. And so I just I
started going through the Reed Hoffman part in particular. And I essentially started to try to
organize or have organized most of my analyses around some core claims that Hoffman made
about his involvement with Epstein. I've just been asking the question,
are these claims true? Are they supported by the record or are they contradicted by the record?
And overwhelmingly, like, absolutely overwhelmingly, they appear to be contradicted relentlessly
by the drop that came out in January 30th. If you want, I think go through some of the big ones.
And then, yeah, let me talk about, yeah, maybe, maybe a place to start is with Reed Hoffman's
statement in 2019 to Axios. This is when, I guess, the Epstein scandal first, I think, became national
news and people who are closely associated with him felt the need to characterize the relationship
with him to distance themselves to explain how they knew him or how closely they knew him. And
Reed's statement at that time was the following, let me just read this out. This is Reed
Hoffman's speaking. My few interactions with Jeffrey Epstein came at the request of Joey Eto
for the purposes of fundraising for the MIT Media Lab. Prior to these interactions, I was told by
Joey that Epstein had cleared the MIT vetting process, which was the basis for my participation.
By last interaction with Epstein was in 2015, still by agreeing to participate in any fundraising
activity where Epstein was present, I helped to repair his reputation and perpetuate injustices
for this time deeply regretful. Oh, can we have break? Is that statement accurate?
Not at all. In fact, it's not just from 2019, he even reiterated this on February 4th, this year,
on X, repeatedly, he said, you only know Jeffrey Epstein because of fundraising relationship
within my T, which is very much regret. These meetings were recorded by Joey Eto, the
director of MIT Media Lab. And he also says, yes, with Joey Eto, the director of MIT Media Lab,
who asked me to help MIT fundraise with Epstein, I regret blah blah blah. Like none of that's at all
true. There's very few mentions of even fundraising with MIT. I would even go so far as I don't
know, I've said it this way on some of my posts, but it's like the extent of the relationship
between Epstein and Reed Hoffman, it almost looks like best friends, like my best friends,
I don't interact with this anywhere near as much as Reed Hoffman and Jeffrey Epstein did over
between 2013 and 2019. There are constant contact, there's something around on the order
of about 400 initiations by Hoffman to Epstein, it wasn't just mediated by Joey Eto at all.
And there are seconds, there are systems where constant contact with each other,
they had extensive financial relationships. There's something like 42 different meetings
that are documented around 20 are absolutely confirmed. They met in person for breakfast,
they would spend each other spend time with each other's, at each other's houses overnight,
meeting, you know, Epstein met his wife. It is claimed that by Hoffman that he only was there
for one night, even the one time that we have absolutely documented that he's referring to,
he was there for two nights, and almost certainly there was two other island visits as well in
addition. It's an extraordinarily extensive personal and business relationship, and it's not just about
Joey Eto. Now, Joey Eto was a really important part of it. Joey Eto was sort of as far as I can tell
again, you guys know a lot more about this than I do, but as far as I could tell, really go through
the fall of the last couple days, Joey Eto was sort of Epstein's gateway into sort of academia,
it came bridge Harvard science. That's sort of his main gateway there. Read Hoffman was his gateway
into Silicon Valley in the tech, the main guy. And so there is a very close relationship as well
between Joey Eto and Hoffman, but there is also very much an independent relationship
between Hoffman and Jeffrey Epstein, very much independent of Joey Eto.
Okay, so Reed claimed that he only had a few interactions with Epstein, that's false,
you're saying he had hundreds, including dozens of in-person meetings and say at the island,
at least once you said for two nights, not one, and there were probably a second or third visit.
There was the stay at the townhouse, Reed claimed that all of his interactions were sort of
mediated by Joey Eto and were about the MIT media lab. By the way, it's not clear why so
one would feel compelled to spend so much time fundraising for MIT, which wasn't even their
alma mater. So this whole explanation didn't really make a lot of sense from the beginning,
but it's pretty clear that the toppings of conversation were not about MIT or MIT media lab,
in fact, I thought one detail that was really kind of interesting was
their first interaction, one of the first was about they bonded over a book called Deception,
which I haven't read the book, I don't know what the thesis is, but it appears
to justify the use of deception in certain circumstances. Anyway, I just think that was
ironic, I guess, if nothing else. Look, I, you know, make a quick comment, yes, go ahead, yes,
yeah, Michael had. Do you want to read Sylvan's attorney in this context? Not exactly,
although I end up, I guess putting myself into a position where it can come across that way,
I'm really trying to be the defense attorney for like sanity. Yeah. So here's what I would say.
I have to just reject the whole premise of this discussion that is so ubiquitous now,
which is that anybody who's so much has exchanged a shortly email with Jeffrey Epstein,
and I know Reed Hoffman apparently had a closer relationship with Epstein than just one.
Email here or there, but the principle that anybody who had some interaction of some
to some degree or another, which I'm free up to, you know, has something that they have to
issue, these millimouth, melodramatic statements of profound apology for, is just so tedious,
and ridiculous, what are they guilty of? If the implication is that there are bias,
association, guilty of enabling pedophilic sex trafficking, that is a flagrant misconception.
Do people know how come it's never clarified that Jeffrey Epstein was never even accused
of committing any illicit sexual acts against any person under the age of 18 after the year 2005?
So I don't know what year's Reed Hoffman and Jeffrey Epstein interacted, but this idea that
he was like looking the other way while all these pre-teens for being raped is just nonsense,
but the media never clarifies it. So now we have everybody from dometramps he to Steve Bannon
being told that their reputation is in tatters, and they are themselves like by association,
some sort of like sex criminal enablers, and it's just a total fantasy.
So Michael. So Michael. Michael. Michael, I think this, I think you're making some really
interesting points. I think they're important, I think. I mean Epstein pleaded guilty to two
prostitution charges in 2008. You're saying Reed Hoffman and Dom Tromsky and Steve Bannon should have
all said, oh, because the guy pleaded guilty to two prostitution charges with what which they were,
that means nobody can ever consort with him ever again for the rest of his life. I think that's
ridiculous. There's two different issues here. One is whether or not there's this global
pedophile ring and you know, we can't even go further and then there's these satanic rituals
and all this other stuff which I'm inclined to think that you're very close to the truth and what
you're saying. On the other hand, there are Reed Hoffman's public statements like dramatically
minimizing the relationship. Now, sure. I think that can easily obviously be explained. There's
an obvious explanation where we don't have to necessarily impune to Reed Hoffman, you know,
being a pedophile or any of these other things that people are wanting to suggest because he lied.
And the alternative explanation is just that this is such a hot potato. There is a hysteria.
So people lie about their relationship with Epstein even though they're not guilty of something
that's terrible behind that. Any association at all is radio with Epstein's radioactive.
I mean, but so if somebody lies, then they can be condemned for the lie because lying.
So that's what we're talking about. And that's what Nick made up a ridiculous lie that was
totally pointless and actually counterproductive for his purposes. And the lie itself can be
condemnable, but not necessarily because our electronics is covering up any kind of pedophilic
sex criminality, just because of the moral hysteria that's been allowed to be unleashed around
this stuff for any connection in any way that Epstein is like grounds for censure.
Yeah, and sorry, let me tell you my point of view on this. So first of all, I think you're correct
that there's a lot of guilt by association happening and there is a little bit of a feeding
frenzy. And like you said, just because someone emailed Epstein doesn't mean that they were
involved with him in some nefarious way. And I thought it was unfair when soccer mentioned that
Jason had, you know, emails with Epstein back in 2011 to make an introduction. I think that's
I haven't even seen that. I mean, yeah, I think it's not important enough even to draw my
attention. Like, it's interesting material in the files, but like Randall and emails. No, no,
I agree. And that's why I tried to defend Jason there. Because I know there's just nothing to that.
Now, in the case of read, I think that there's a couple of things that are interesting about this.
Number one is when this new Epstein files drop happened, we came out on X and very aggressively
started pointing the finger at other people wildly accusing both Elon Musk and Donald Trump
of somehow being involved in Epstein's purported crimes. And this is just a classic case of someone
throwing stones living in a glass house. I mean, you look at his own statements from 2019 all the way
up to weeks ago. And they don't hold water at all. He lies about the extent of his relationship
with Epstein, how many times they met, what the subject matter was, what the context was,
how many times he visited the island potentially. I mean, just one lie after another,
while again, wildly accusing other people. And you do have to just ask what is going on here.
Yeah. And I mean, that just goes to show how weaponizable this whole thing is and how the Epstein
story or any kind of tangential connection to Epstein can be leveraged to serve some kind of
pre-existing agenda. So if like readhauffin and Elon Musk don't like each other, then they could
accuse each other of like having a more closer connection to Epstein than they did. And it's just like
a slug fest. And yet I'm still struggling to understand what the underlying accusation of wrong
doing is supposed to be above and beyond just how perhaps readhauffin and or Musker,
might have misrepresented the relationship. Well, the question, the question is also partly like,
why did he need to so aggressively attack others? Why did he need to so aggressively lie about the
relationship? Is it just that he's covering himself because of a moral hysteria or is there, I don't know?
Well, I mean, my theory on this, I think it's kind of obvious what he's doing is that by pointing
the finger at Trump or Elon, actually both, he's driving everyone into their partisan tribes,
right? So as to I think seek protection of the Democrat tribe to which he's contribute to hundreds
of millions of dollars. And I think it's worked. I mean, you look at the mainstream media coverage
of this, the New York Times coverage of it, which we talked about on previous episode of the show,
they wrote an article about Epstein's ties to Silicon Valley. Other people who had far less
extensive of a relationship with Epstein got paragraphs in that story, readhauffin was only mentioned
in one sentence along with three other people. So he does seem to be getting a pass from, you know,
Michael, if, you know, you want to criticize this as a feeding friends of your moral panic or a
hysteria, what have you? Whenever it is, he seems to be getting a pass from the media. And my point
about this has not been to accuse read of crimes because I don't think we have any basis for that
whatsoever. Let me just state that clearly. If I will see all this then, no, well, let me get to that.
My point has just been that the media needs to cover this in a fair and even handed way, as
it goes together. Like you said, weaponizing it to go after the people they don't like because
there's political advantage in that. Or another parallel is Hillary Clinton just came out this week
and gave an interview on the BBC where she said, we, the Clinton's Bill and I, we had no real
connections with Epstein, but Donald Trump, we can just assume as unassalively true that he's in the
process of orchestrating a cover up because he has something to hide. And then on the other hand,
Trump will toggle back and forth between Bill Clinton and Larry Summers and Reed Hoffman. There are
the ones who are truly implicated by their association with Epstein. I had nothing really to do with
the guy. And then the next day he'll say, oh, I'm a little upset or Rufull that Bill Clinton's been
dragged into this mess. And it just gets, you know, framed around or organized around just like a
partisan battering ram. And it just becomes incredibly tedious because it doesn't even have to be any
more any concrete allegation of any wrongdoing whatsoever. There's no credible allegation of any
pedophilic wrongdoing by either Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Reed Hoffman, Elon Musk, anybody's like,
what are we talking about here ultimately? We're like in this other domain of like who could
establish the most damning guilt by association, even though nobody can spell out what
the guilt is supposed to be tied to? Well, and here's the question is, why did Reed so
brazenly lie about his relationship with Epstein? It could just be what he was looking to
lie. Well, it could just be that he wants to protect his reputation in business by minimizing
the association. But obviously, when you lie that extensively in that brazenly about it,
it is going to make people think that you have something to cover up. And, you know, I think that
people think a lot of dumb things. I mean, is there like any evidence at all that would kind
that would tie Reed Hoffman to some kind of child sex crime? Not the none. I'm not accusing him of that.
So if people think that's what's being covered up, then they should be disobused of that
fleshes notion, rather than countenencing the notion and allowing the mass hysteria to continue
proliferating unhindered. I'm going to ask you something, Michael, what evidence is there
for so on the island or in general, what evidence is there that people were being trafficked? Maybe
not minors did that actually where people actually going to the island for that purpose was that
that extensive or not? It's impossible to know what people even mean by trafficking anymore.
Trafficking is incredibly nebulous concept. It's very much open to the whims and discretion of
prosecutors who seek to fit some fact pattern to a desire to prosecute somebody for some sort of
sexual related offense. If it involves simply facilitating the movements of somebody
from point A to point B. So if adult women, consentially flew on an airplane to go visit a
luxury island in the Caribbean and over the course of that visit, maybe they engage in some
consensual sex act. And then 20 years later, they can retroactively classify it as trafficking.
And that will entitle them to millions of dollars in tax-free settlement money. Are we going to take
a face value that constitutes trafficking? Because I don't. I'm always a little bit mystified as
to what we're supposed to understand is trafficking now. So you're overall perspective on this
is basically that a lot of the discourse about this is constructed and we don't really understand
the underlying facts. Is that your, I mean, I understand the underlying facts to the greatest
degree that I can ascertain them. And I think that they are just chronically and almost unbelievably
mischaracterized everywhere you look. Let me get you to react to this tweet that someone just
at mentioned you all. Oh, here we go. Yeah. And feedback. Well, this is okay. This is a guy. I
don't know this guy. It's present witness. But this is what he's saying is the evidence. Okay.
So I just, you know, I want to give you a reaction to it. Well, let me read this for people who are
just listening and can't see the screen. And then I'll get your reaction to it. So he says, here's the
evidence. 160 million dollars from me on black. 50 million dollar townhouse and power of attorney
over Westerners of state. Cameras in his residence wired by his really government compromising photos
of Prince Andrew Clinton, et cetera. Confirm sex trafficking of underage girls from Maxwell
Bernel and others teaching job with William Barr, Prince C. C. I. A. Kishogi was a client of
Epstein, Prince C. Money laundering for intelligence, question mark, advisor to a who'd
Barack and the Roth child's rummeler, chief who is a chiefly officer, Goldman Sachs and former White
House counsel under Obama was a key advisor and backup executive as well. There are millions of
files still redacted and none of them released by C. A. State Department. This is just the
tip of the iceberg. Anyone telling you that there's nothing to see here is attempting to
whitewash the most important revealing intelligence-related story of our lifetimes. And then
he calls you out here. Michael Tracy doesn't understand that it's between evidence and proof.
And it is simply exploiting sexually abused women for engagement.
Okay. I mean, first of all, I don't know what that guy is even arguing all that stuff is supposed
to be evidence of. Like what is the ultimate contention that he's claiming those
myriad scattered data points are supposed to justify. I mean, that's why that's what's so strange
about this story. Nobody can really ever articulate. Like soccer struggled to articulate what
I suspect actually is his ultimate belief, which is that there was some kind of pedotrafking
operation. Like he, I think, said that he agreed with the Thomas Massey quote that I
read out to him. But on its face, that's sort of like a bizarre statement to make. So they latch on to
this other peripheral stuff around intelligence and whatnot. And that guy said how dare anyone
ever say there's nothing to see here and he hascribed that to me. I've never said there's nothing
to see here. People tell me all the time that I allegedly have said there's nothing to see here.
But I don't say that at all. I'm pretty much as obsessed if not more obsessed with this story
than anyone at this point to agree. It's probably not very healthy mentally.
But you're so obsessed with it. But I'm obsessed with it in the sense that you think this
is a modern day, Salem, which trial, which is fascinating. Yeah. So you're fascinated from
like a sociological standpoint, which is, have humans of all beyond where they were 100 years
ago engaging in, which hunts and things like that. Or do you think it's interesting, it's
I think it's interesting in other ways, definitely in that way as well. But there are other ways
in which it's interesting. I think it's almost interesting as an anthropological survey
of sorts among elite smoovers and shakers. You could say where Epstein did have this extraordinary
ability to network and to convene people who probably otherwise would never have been convened.
So I've been saying that I think Jeffrey Epstein is the only man on earth who could have brought
together for a friendly social powwow, Nome Chomsky and Steve Bannon, like I'm almost jealous of
that. I mean, I'm sure that would have very, very fascinating discussion to listen in on, right?
And there are other examples. And so I think it's interesting from that perspective.
I mean, I think everything that every little piece of information that can be uncovered
about Jeffrey Epstein's life is now almost intrinsically interesting, just given the salience of
the story, right? So I guess I'm interested just from that perspective, because like obviously he's
now a historic, a world of story, even figure. And so yeah, I'm always, I'm always down to find
out something new about what Jeffrey was up to. So sure, I think it's interesting politically just
in terms of how this can be leveraged into some sort of political, battering ram against enemies.
And, you know, this is like the number one oppositional Trump narrative of the second term.
It's almost Russia gate redux in the outsized prominence that Democrats are giving it in
terms of what they bring up they have today in hopes of it undercutting Trump or bedevilling
so it doesn't have to be like the new Russia gate in that way where every possible
tangential fact is somehow connected and the whole thing kind of attestizes and is used in a
partisan weaponized way. Yeah. And there's an international component like this is the number one
scandal right now that's ravaging Norway, Slovakia was mentioning obviously Great Britain today
and other places, you know, United Arab Emirates, um, name your country. So there's an inner,
like it's, if an internationalized which is just fascinating as well, they didn't, didn't,
they burned like an effigy of Jeffrey Epstein and Iran or something. I mean, it just never ends.
So of course, there's like infinite fascinating material, at least to me, I just don't accept
that in order to be fascinated by this, we must, but we must, you know, have this weird epistemology
where we can just collect all these discrepent little pieces of information, blast them out on the
internet and then just think that we've done the argumentative and logical work necessarily. Yes,
sorry, to somehow establish how that proves our ultimate notions about what the story is supposed
to signify, which again is pedophilic sex trafficking enforced by blackmail that it snared
from an individual's at the direction of some intelligence agency. That's the crux of the Epstein
mythology and it's been systematically unraveled, included, you know, partially by this, the
disclosure of more Epstein files, but even prior to January 30th or December 19th, the two
productions, there was never any credible evidence for any of it. So yeah, I am fascinated in terms of
how people come to believe such mythological things and the journalistic malfeasance, again,
that has been characterizing the story as well as a particular interest to me because they,
it's been a central factor in how the mythology has been allowed to just kind of proliferate
without any counter-revelling point of view. I think that's a pretty good place for us to wrap up.
Kevin, do you have any final thoughts? I'll just continue releasing some of this stuff. I tend to
agree with Michael, but you know, I also think that sticking to the facts is also very important
to and telling the truth is important in both directions as well. So can I just make one for
a concluding file? I actually do think it's, you know, I'm happy for this opportunity to speak on
your podcast. I assume I'm reaching an audience that probably would not otherwise hear of me
at too large extent. And because I do think it's actually very disturbing that so many people around
the world are being told that it's somehow been proven or vindicated that there is a massive
child rape ring or that there were mass-child rapes that were allowed to be perpetrated
by the highest levels of government and then were covered up because as I mentioned on Pierce
Morgan this week, it's very easy to imagine how people with the predisposition toward mental illness
who hear this stuff and believe it might be driven to do something like homicide or crazy.
So I'm not predicting anything in particular. I just think it's, it's probably the most
explosive thing to tell the mass public in terms of what it might
insight, particular people with a particular mental instability to do. So I mean that's just one
of the potentially detrimental effects of all this that I think it should be rationally counter to
the maximum extent possible. And I think we're going to be present with this issue for the foreseeable
future. So at a certain point, I don't know, maybe there should be a little bit more momentum behind
providing some degree of irrational corrective. I mean, or does it, is it just me? I mean,
am I the only guy who's going to be doing this forever more? I mean, there's some more who
have come to take on a little bit more of a skeptical perspective. But, well, I think we have we
should be cognizant of the real world ramifications rather than just speaking about it in the abstract
who suffers more, read Hop in Versailles on Moscow, all this other stuff. I think it really is a
crazy-making thing that's been inculcated in the public. Yeah, well, look, I think both of you
have performed very valuable services for the public in regards to this whole episode. I think
Michael, you are asking really important questions about evidence-free standards. And what is the basis
for some of the more, let's call them, Epstein Maxwell's claims out there, again, about the
global pedophile ring and so forth. And I think you're right that when you're talking about
crimes, you have to be evidence-driven and there is a little bit of a feeding frenzy here.
And it is appropriate to ask what the motivations are of everyone involved in the story.
And you're one of the only people who are doing it, although it does seem like you are making
a difference or does seem to be a vibe shift a little bit around what you're going. Yeah, so those
people who have, like, who have their brains wired in a normal way, which would not include
would probably have, and I'm like, a negative emotional reaction to being inundated day and in
day out with accusations of personally being a pedophile or harbouring like to pray sexual fantasies
of, they're just ancient children and whatever, but like, you know, obviously that is not the case
for me. But I can withstand it because I'm used to the poor into vitriol, but most people, I think
probably would be dissuaded from taking a certain angle on a certain subject. If that's what they had
do in dirt. Well, the mob does not like being accused of being a mob and their defense mechanism
seems to be to accuse anyone who points out some of these problems in the logic of basically
somehow being involved in the crimes that they're alleging. So in any event, I do think that you are
performing a valuable service. You know, when Hollywood dramatizes this, it's, you know,
it's like Henry Fonda and the oxbow incident, or maybe it's Gregory Peck and to kill a
mockingbird, you've got a mob, and you have this one lone figure who's standing at the work
the mob trying to talk sense into them. And, you know, in real life, it's not Gregory Peck,
it's like a guy in a one bedroom apartment in New Jersey. Yes. For all the money, I'm told
I'm surrogately receiving from Leslie Wexner and the Mesa, I mean, I wish I could get some better
digs, but yeah. And Kevin, I do think that what you're doing is really important because I think that
the citizen journalism here that's sleuding through the Epstein files is turning up really interesting
things. And I do not think it's appropriate for me to be, again, wildly pointing the finger at
other people while the evidence shows that he's been bold face lying about every aspect of his
relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. And to be honest, if he had diskept his mouth shut and not accused
other people, I'm not even sure this would be a topic. On the show, I would just wait to let the
chips fall where they may and see what ultimately comes out about this. But he kind of put himself
in play by saying all of these things and I do think it's appropriate to examine the record and
and assess his credibility on that basis. And you've done that job and I hope you and other people
will keep going through the files and actually seeing what is actually there so we can get to the
truth of this story. I agree and thank you. Well, let's wrap it there. I just want to make one final
point, which is, you know, even when years ago, this was sort of a cost lab on the right where you
had right-wing podcast pointing the finger at Bill Clinton or other left-wing figures. I never waited
in on this. I wasn't sure what to think. I still am not completely sure what to think about it.
I don't want to get over my skis in terms of overly associating myself with any one point of
you because I think when people do that, they do kind of dig in and I'm keeping it open my
with respect to what comes out next. It would not surprise me at all if Michael Tracy turned out
to be correct, but also it wouldn't completely surprise me of some version of Sagar's version
of the story proved to be correct, assuming more evidence comes out. So I'm keeping it open mind.
I do think it's really important for us to evaluate the claims critically, which is why I think
it's important to hear from people like Michael Tracy and I look forward to seeing what comes next
and we'll address it then. I try to be rigorously evidence-based as well myself. So I don't
discount the idea that something could theoretically come out. That would undermine some of the
assumptions or conclusions that I've derived from my research and reporting on this. So I think
that's a healthy epistemological habit. It'd always be open to the possibility of something
that's in contravention of your prior assumptions being presented to you.
That's what I would fully agree. Okay, we'll leave it there. Thanks guys.
We should all just get a room and just have one big huge or two because they're all
useless. It's like this sexual tension that we just need to release them out.
