# 2026-02-14 - Website & Pipeline Enhancements

## Major Website Redesign
- **New Layout:** 3-column grid (Definitions 2/7, Insights+Tickers 3/7, Overton Window 2/7)
- **Renamed Sections:**
  - "Ticking Tickers" → "AI Alpha & Asset Atrophy"
  - "Definitions" → "Digital Definitions to Define Directions"
- **Added Second Order F-X section** with supply chain beneficiaries (single column in right sidebar)
- **Contact Form** with verification system and weekly updates opt-in
- **Disclaimer** added at bottom
- **Title symbols:** QQQ and Bitcoin (₿) with live prices in header
- **Live price data** from Yahoo Finance for 47 tickers (2-week % change)

## Enhanced Stock Scoring System
- **Multi-factor scoring (0-100+ scale):**
  - Mention count (base 10 pts)
  - Conviction detection (keywords: "deep dive", "thesis", "conviction")
  - Source diversity multiplier (2+ sources = 1.5x, 3+ = 2x)
  - Contrarian signals (+20 for "unloved", -30 for "crowded")
  - Recency bonus (+15 for first mention within 30 days)
  - Hidden play bonus (+15 for supply chain beneficiaries)
- **Categories:** Consensus Buys, Hidden Gems, Contrarian Plays, Early Signals, Thematic
- **Hidden Play Mapping:** NVDA → Power (NEE, CEG), Cooling (CWST), Networking (ANET)

## Notifications Setup
- **Pushover:** Configured for alerts (newsletter analysis, pipeline failures)
- **iMessage:** Two-way communication working
- **Cron jobs updated** to send notifications on completion/failure

## Pipeline Updates
- `analyze_enhanced.py` - New multi-factor analysis with conviction detection
- `generate_charts.py` - Generates charts for 47 tickers (primary + second-order)
- `contacts.py` - Contact management with verification and subscription handling
- Charts update daily at 9:00am CST
- Newsletter check at 8:30am CST

## Podcast Feeds
- Moonshots with Peter Diamandis IS in feed (https://feeds.megaphone.fm/moonshot)
- iyO episode approved for transcription
- Food waste episode excluded due to keywords (can whitelist if needed)

## Key Decisions
- Focus on research/think pieces over live data (prices from Yahoo Finance charts)
- Show 9 Second Order F-X tickers max to keep page clean
- All price data embedded in HTML for reliability
- 3-column layout with middle column widest for ticker display
