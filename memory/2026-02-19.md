# 2026-02-19 - Website Fixes and Improvements

## Major Fixes Completed

### 1. Insights Display Bug (Root Cause Fixed)
- **Problem**: New insights weren't showing because `loadInsights()` filtered to only show items with matching Deep Dives
- **Fix**: Removed the Deep Dive requirement filter, now shows all `display_on_main=1` insights
- **Result**: All 8 latest insights now display correctly, sorted newest-first

### 2. Added 7 New Deep Dives to Database
Created comprehensive Deep Dive analysis for:
- Jack Mallers: Japan/Bitcoin liquidity shock
- Paul Krugman: Dollar resilience & AI deflation
- Dario Amodei: End of exponential
- Sam Altman: AI CEO vision
- Noor Siddiqui/Orchard: Genetic health revolution
- Moonshots EP231: 400x AI cost collapse
- Moonshots EP232: Ben Horowitz on xAI/SSI/Apple crisis

### 3. Two New Moonshots Episodes Added
- **EP#231** (Feb 18): 400x AI Cost Collapse & India Talent Decade
- **EP#232** (Feb 19): Ben Horowitz on xAI Exodus, Ilya's $5B SSI, Apple's AI Crisis
- Both fully transcribed (local Whisper), analyzed, and added to database with Deep Dives

### 4. Ticker Scoring Fixed
- **Before**: All tickers showed static values (conviction=medium, contrarian=neutral, timeframe=long)
- **After**: Dynamic calculation from ticker_mentions data:
  - Conviction: high (≥70), medium (≥40), low (<40) based on avg_conviction
  - Contrarian: calculated from sentiment distribution
  - Timeframe: most common timeframe from mentions
- **Result**: 8 tickers now show "high" conviction, 8 show "medium"

### 5. Price Data Fixed (2-Week Calculation)
- **Before**: Inconsistent 10-day or single-day change calculations
- **After**: Proper 14-day (2 week) change: (Current - Price_14d_ago) / Price_14d_ago
- Updated both fetch_prices.py and generate_charts.py to use consistent 14-day period
- All charts now show 14 days ending today with correct axis labels

### 6. Layout Changes
- Removed Second Order F-X section entirely
- Moved "Alpha or Atrophy" to right column below Overton Window
- Fixed Deep Dive button alignment (now right-aligned in expanded cards)
- Removed redundant thesis display from expanded insight cards
- Limited main page to exactly 8 most recent insights

### 7. Data Integrity
- Removed duplicate insights (older Sam Altman AI CEO and Jack Mallers entries)
- Fixed data.js cache version to force browser reloads

## Files Modified

- `pipeline/auto_pipeline.py` - Fixed aggregate_scores() with proper calculations
