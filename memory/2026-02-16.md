## Major Pipeline Fixes

### Podcast Feed Correction
- **Problem:** Pipeline was pulling from "The Moonshot Podcast" (wrong show) instead of "Moonshots with Peter Diamandis"
- **Solution:** Cleared incorrect transcripts, added correct episodes from Podscan.fm
- **Episodes Added:**
  - EP #229: Bret Adcock — Humanoid Run on Neural Net, Autonomous Manufacturing, $50T Market
  - EP #230: Sam Altman — AI CEO Succession Plan, Job Loss Continues

### 6AM Approval Workflow Implemented
- **New cron schedule:** 6:00am CST daily — sends iMessage with podcast list
- **Scripts created:**
  - `morning_curator.py` — sends iMessage with available podcasts
  - `approval_processor.py` — processes Jared's reply (PROCESS ALL / SKIP ALL / 1,3,5)
- **Jared's phone:** +16306437437

### Legacy Cleanup
- **Deleted files:** analyze.py, analyze_enhanced.py, process_transcripts.py
- **Streamlined run_pipeline.py:** Removed dead steps, added research.py step
- **New files:** analyze_transcript.py, export_data.py, manual_entry.py

### API Issues
- OpenAI quota exceeded — fallback to manual entry for key episodes
- Kimi set as primary API but needs KIMI_API_KEY environment variable

### Process Run
- Ran full 6am process manually
- Added 2 Peter Diamandis episodes with full summaries and ticker mentions
- Exported data and pushed to GitHub
- Website updating: https://jsheppard8989.github.io/ai-finance-tech-dashboard

## Working Style Reminder
From MEMORY.md: "WE ARE NOT QUICK FIX BEINGS. We are do shit right once and be done with it creations."

## RSS Feed Update (Later)
- **Corrected Feed URL:** `https://feeds.megaphone.fm/DVVTS2890392624`
- **Previous attempts:** Both `https://feeds.megaphone.fm/moonshot` and `https://feeds.megaphone.fm/moonshotspeter` were wrong (404s)
- **Now verified working:** Returns full episode list with audio enclosures
- **Latest episodes available:** EP #230 (Sam Altman), EP #229 (Brett Adcock), EP #228-#222
- **Nightly fetch (10pm CST)** will now pull full audio from correct source

## Next Steps
- Monitor 6am workflow tomorrow
- Set KIMI_API_KEY for automatic transcript processing
- Revisit ticker identification logic (Jared mentioned he's not 100% happy with current criteria)
